Just gross!</p><p><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hes-obsessed-with-menstruation-ex-producer-exposes-trumps-bizarre-apprentice-behavior/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hes-obsessed-with-menstruation-ex-producer-exposes-trumps-bizarre-apprentice-behavior/&apos;, &apos;RawStory&apos;);">RawStory</a>&#xA0;reported that former producers of <em>The Apprentice</em>, the&#xA0;Donald Trump (R-N.Y.) reality TV show, are coming forward to talk. They don&#x2019;t want to be named, however, because they say they&#x2019;ve signed nondisclosure agreements. Even so, these guys are more than ready to spill the beans on the man who used to literally run the show.</p><p>In an interview with Slate, some former staffers on the show talked about Trump&#x2019;s strange behaviors. They said, for example, that he wouldn&#x2019;t ever touch people because he had a fear of germs.</p><p>Personally, that makes me wonder if he saw Leo DiCaprio playing Howard Hughes in <em><a href="http://movies.about.com/od/theaviator/a/aviatorld121004.htm" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://movies.about.com/od/theaviator/a/aviatorld121004.htm&apos;, &apos;The Aviator&apos;);">The Aviator</a></em>. Can&#x2019;t you just picture Trump imagining himself as the eccentric millionaire with his OCD? Or picturing himself as the handsome and charismatic DiCaprio?</p><p>Anyway, I digress.</p><p>The reality TV folks told Slate that they wanted to come forward to tell their stories&#xA0;out of a sense of guilt, and patriotic duty. One former producer <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hes-obsessed-with-menstruation-ex-producer-exposes-trumps-bizarre-apprentice-behavior/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hes-obsessed-with-menstruation-ex-producer-exposes-trumps-bizarre-apprentice-behavior/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Those of us involved in the show are proud of our work. But we might have given the guy a platform and created this candidate. It&#x2019;s guys like him, narcissists with dark Machiavellian traits, who dominate in our culture, on TV, and in the political realm. It can be dangerous when we confuse stories we&#x2019;re told with reality. We need to wake up&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s from someone who helped tell these stories.&#x201D;</em></p><p>So they talked. Boy, did they talk. They told stories about how often they had to edit and cut the footage to remove any indication that Trump had ever made a bad decision.</p><p>The worst stories, and certainly the most disgusting ones, involved Trump&#x2019;s constant disrespect for the women who appeared on the show. The producer described Trump talking about women&#x2019;s bodies in front of the women themselves and the staffers all around.</p><p>He described one time in particular, when Trump was in the control room at Trump tower, where the show was shot. He was wearing a live mic, but didn&#x2019;t seem to care who could hear him.

Maybe she had her period then</em>.&#x201D;</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>The producer was aghast. He added to his description of Trump, <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hes-obsessed-with-menstruation-ex-producer-exposes-trumps-bizarre-apprentice-behavior/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hes-obsessed-with-menstruation-ex-producer-exposes-trumps-bizarre-apprentice-behavior/&apos;, &apos;saying&apos;);">saying</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;During the campaign, when he was talking about Megyn Kelly, I thought: He&#x2019;s obsessed with menstruation.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Yuck. Just yuck.</p><p>When the people who used to work closely with the candidate come out of the woodwork to say how guilty they feel about his success, we have a very serious problem on our hands.</p><p>Watch this Slate video for more information on weird Trumpims:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_iT5V0e3qr4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured Image A Screenshot Of Slate Video Via&#xA0;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iT5V0e3qr4" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iT5V0e3qr4&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);">YouTube</a>.&#xA0;</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
