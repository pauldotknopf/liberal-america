<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>Sensing that the tide is turning against his organization and the merchants of death he represents in the gun industry, National Rifle Association (NRA)&#xA0;Executive Vice President resorted to the only tactic he and his despicable ammosexual cult have left: Fear.</p><p>Appearing on &#x201C;Face the Nation,&#x201D; LaPierre &#xA0;<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/theyre-coming-nras-wayne-lapierre-responds-to-orlando-shooting-with-unhinged-fearmongering/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/theyre-coming-nras-wayne-lapierre-responds-to-orlando-shooting-with-unhinged-fearmongering/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>&#xA0;&#x201C;we all mourn&#x201D; for victims of the Orlando shooting, &#x201C;but we face a terrorist challenge where they are on the verge of overwhelming us.&#x201D;</p><p>Then, as expected, LaPierre tried to blame President Obama and anyone else who calls for sensible gun control legislation such as universal background checks and not letting suspected terrorists purchase weapons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSWHt45yDM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSWHt45yDM&apos;, &apos;LaPierre said&apos;);" target="_blank">LaPierre said</a> that was merely an attempt to &#x201C;divert&#x201D; attention away from the real threat:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t save the country with politics. It&#x2019;s all being politicized with a politically correct White House&#x2019;s nose and fingers in areas they don&#x2019;t belong.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Politicizing the gun issue. Yeah, the NRA would never stoop to that level as they funnel money and lobbying favors to lawmakers as a way of bribing them to never consider any legislation that might help control the flood of guns in this country.</p><p>After that, LaPierre then pivoted back to spreading fear, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSWHt45yDM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSWHt45yDM&apos;, &apos;saying of terrorists&apos;);" target="_blank">saying of terrorists</a> who might acquire guns:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We need to look right in the face of what these people are, they don&#x2019;t care about the law. I mean, these bad guys we&#x2019;re facing, they don&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Oh gosh, they passed a law. Oh gosh, I don&#x2019;t think I can do it.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s like what we&#x2019;re doing with this debate on the hill right now, it&#x2019;s like they are trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Here&#x2019;s the solution the NRA chief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSWHt45yDM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSWHt45yDM&apos;, &apos;suggested for&apos;);" target="_blank">suggested for</a> all that ails America:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The fact is, we need to face what&#x2019;s coming. They&#x2019;re trying to kill us. They&#x2019;re not going to attack hard targets&#x2026; They&#x2019;re going to go for shopping malls, they&#x2019;re going to go for churches. The fact is, we need vigilance, we need preparedness. We need a full court press on personal protection.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get the bad guys off the street, attack the terrorists and leave the good guys alone.&#x201D;</em></p><p>One thing I&#x2019;ve often wondered about: How does Wayne LaPierre and others of his ilk sleep at night with all of the innocent blood on their hands?</p><p>Watch LaPierre turn to fear instead of logic:</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LgSWHt45yDM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
