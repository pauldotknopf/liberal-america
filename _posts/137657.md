Weaver also said the campaign has no plans to lobby superdelegates in the future.</p><p>Appearing on the MSNBC show &#x201C;With All Due Respect,&#x201D; <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283850-sanders-camp-no-longer-lobbying-superdelegates" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283850-sanders-camp-no-longer-lobbying-superdelegates&apos;, &apos;Weaver said&apos;);" target="_blank">Weaver said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not currently lobbying superdelegates.

After centuries of racism, sexism and discrimination of all forms in our country, we do not need a major party candidate who makes bigotry the cornerstone of his campaign.&#xA0;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We cannot have a president who insults Mexicans and Latinos, Muslims, women and African-Americans. We cannot have a president who, in the midst of so much income and wealth inequality, wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very rich. We cannot have a president who, despite all of the scientific evidence, believes that climate change is a hoax.&#x201D;</em></p><p>However, Sanders did not say that he would formally suspend or terminate his campaign, which in recent weeks has been reported to be short of cash.</p><p>It appears that the main focus of the Sanders campaign is now aimed at the platform which will be adopted at the Democratic convention in July.&#xA0;Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-not-dropping-out_us_57634656e4b0fbbc8be9e5d1?section=" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-not-dropping-out_us_57634656e4b0fbbc8be9e5d1?section=&apos;, &apos;says the issues&apos;);" target="_blank">says the issues</a> which are most important for inclusion in the platform are raising the minimum wage, campaign finance reform, universal healthcare, and more affordable college tuition.</p><p>Recent reports have also noted that Sanders has lost nearly all of his leverage when it comes to the upcoming convention.
