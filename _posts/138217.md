Remember Donald Trump&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygIDdXEpPnk" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygIDdXEpPnk&apos;, &apos;speech&apos;);">speech</a> after the Orlando shooting, when he mistakenly described the shooter as born in Afghanistan?</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The killer, who&#x2019;s name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This statement was simply not true, as the shooter was in fact an American citizen born in Queens. Trump&#x2019;s relationship with truths and facts during his presidential campaign has appeared questionable at best, but surprisingly, this time the error doesn&#x2019;t seem to be of any fault of his own.</p><p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/trump-accidentally-read-wrong-speech-off-his-teleprompter-after-orlando-shooting/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/trump-accidentally-read-wrong-speech-off-his-teleprompter-after-orlando-shooting/&apos;, &apos;Mediate&apos;);">Mediate</a> found the following amusing factoid buried in a piece published earlier today by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-20/trump-strategy-meeting" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-20/trump-strategy-meeting&apos;, &apos;Bloomberg Politics&apos;);">Bloomberg Politics</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Trump made a factual error during his post-Orlando shooting speech because his staff accidentally uploaded the wrong speech into his teleprompter.&#x201D;</em></p><p>According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-20/trump-strategy-meeting" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-20/trump-strategy-meeting&apos;, &apos;Bloomberg Politics&apos;);">Bloomberg Politics</a>, many in Trump&#x2019;s inner circle had predicted that he&#xA0;would get a bump in the polls following his speech, the same way his popularity rose after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.</p><p>In reality, he was slammed by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party and new <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/16/sad-moment-donald-trump-tables-finally-turned-video/">ratings</a> show that his popularity has declined. They seized on the mistake in his speech about the New York-born shooter being from Afghanistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Staffers had accidentally uploaded the wrong version of the speech into the teleprompter, and later posted the correct version on Trump&#x2019;s Facebook page.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The version posted to Trump&#x2019;s website is accurate:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Is this perhaps why Trump just <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/20/breaking-trump-fires-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski/">fired</a> his longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski?</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ygIDdXEpPnk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
