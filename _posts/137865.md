<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>For those jonesing for Jon Stewart&#x2019;s comedic battles with Donald Trump, you&#x2019;ll be happy to know that Seth Meyers has stepped up to the plate. This week, Meyers has outdone himself.</p><p>Meyers eviscerated the tangerine-haired one&#x2019;s response to the Orlando shootings on Monday:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;When it comes to bigotry, Trump keeps upping his game. He&#x2019;s like if Joseph McCarthy was exposed to gamma radiation and became a racist, orange Hulk but with tiny hands.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Meyers proceeded to comically rip into Trump&#x2019;s Obama&#x2019;s-A-Secret-Muslim <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/13/watch-donald-trump-tries-imply-president-obama-secretly-muslim/" target="_blank">dog whistle</a> response to the shootings and his subsequent decision to <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/13/donald-trump-washington-post-youre-fired/" target="_blank">ban The Washington Post</a> from covering his campaign after they called him out on it.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;By election day, the only media outlets that are going to be allowed on Trump&#x2019;s campaign will be the National Enquirer and Rich Pricks Monthly.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Then Meyers took a stand in solidarity with The Post and banned Trump from Late Night.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You missed out, buddy. We could have gone to Coney Island and ridden The Cyclone in a segment we would have called, &#x201C;Will His Hair Move?&#x201D;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[&#x2026;] Or better still, we could have driven around together while you yelled out the window at immigrants, in Carpool Scare-aoke.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Meyers admitted that Trump has no desire to appear on Late Night. But, naturally, Mr. Thin Skin couldn&#x2019;t let this slight go un-avenged. He told <a href="http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/donald-trump-seth-meyers-1201796496/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/donald-trump-seth-meyers-1201796496/&apos;, &apos;Variety&apos;);" target="_blank">Variety</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;&#x2018;He has begged me to do the show for the last two years. I have told him emphatically &#x2018;no,&#x2019; Trump said in a statement released by his campaign. &#x2018;I only like doing shows with good ratings, which as everybody knows, I only make better (by a lot).&apos;&#x201D;</em></p><p>Actually, as <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/06/donald-trumps-latest-target-seth-meyers-224430" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/06/donald-trumps-latest-target-seth-meyers-224430&apos;, &apos;Politico&apos;);" target="_blank">Politico</a> pointed out, Meyers&#x2019; ratings beat his competition as well as many of the cable news shows Trump regularly calls in to.</p><p>Meyers has since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlm-AMw0zgw" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlm-AMw0zgw&apos;, &apos;comically doubled down&apos;);" target="_blank">comically doubled down</a> on his ban. And he came up with what he called a &#x201C;generous offer&#x201D; for Trump: Drop out of the race and he can play the role of president in a 13-hour NBC series (not yet approved by NBC suits).</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We can even, for you, write a scene where a judge just outright admits he&#x2019;s biased against you because he&#x2019;s Hispanic and that he&#x2019;s jealous because he couldn&#x2019;t get into Trump University and had to go to a lesser school &#x2013; like Harvard.&#x201D;</em></p><p>I&#x2019;m not the only one who thinks Meyers is filling Stewart&#x2019;s shoes. <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/if-you-miss-jon-stewarts-war-on-bullsht-turn-on-seth-meyers/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/if-you-miss-jon-stewarts-war-on-bullsht-turn-on-seth-meyers/&apos;, &apos;Raw Story&apos;);" target="_blank">Raw Story</a> has also noticed that Meyers&#x2019; bull***t detector is almost as good as Stewart&#x2019;s.</p><p>Thank God!</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Enjoy the two examples below, from &#x201C;Late Night with Seth Meyers.&#x201D;</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kygQLLhos5k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xWs3eh5u7Ic?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Featured image screengrab via YouTube</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
