<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>It was big news when the United States Treasury announced earlier this year that Andrew Jackson would soon be replaced by Harriet Tubman on the face of the $20 bill. But apparently that&#x2019;s just too much for Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King, who is now trying to defund the Treasury effort to put Tubman on the twenty.</p><p>King has introduced&#xA0;<a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/KINGIA_289_xml62016115509559.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;pageview&apos;, &apos;http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/KINGIA_289_xml62016115509559.pdf&apos;);" target="_blank" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2}}">an amendment</a> that would bar the Treasury Department from spending any funds to redesign paper money or coin currency. If his legislation is approved, the language would&#xA0;effectively mean that Jackson&#x2013;one of the worst Presidents in American history&#x2013;would remain in the $20 bill.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s be perfectly clear about Steve King. He is a notoriously racist and xenophobic piece of crap who <a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/steve-king-still-stands-by-cantaloupe-comments/?_r=1" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/steve-king-still-stands-by-cantaloupe-comments/?_r=1&apos;, &apos;loves to spew&apos;);" target="_blank">loves to spew</a> anti-immigration rhetoric nearly every single time he opens his hateful mouth.</p><p>Now let&#x2019;s take a look at Andrew Jackson and Harriet Tubman.</p><h4><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson&apos;, &apos;Andrew Jackson&apos;);" target="_blank">Andrew Jackson</a>:</strong></h4><ul>
<li>Ordered the deaths of thousands of Native Americans</li>
<li>Was reportedly cruel to troops under his command</li>

<li>Aided John Brown as he prepared his 1859 anti-slavery raid on Harper&#x2019;s Ferry</li>
<li>A&#xA0;prominent participant in the Underground Railroad, a network of abolitionists who helped guide escaped slaves to freedom</li>
</ul><p>But of course what disqualifies her for Congressman King is that Tubman was black. Oh, he&#x2019;ll never say that in public, but considering the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2008/03/08/20152/steve-king-record/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2008/03/08/20152/steve-king-record/&apos;, &apos;things he\&apos;s said&apos;);" target="_blank">things he&#x2019;s said</a> over the years about President Obama, it has a lot to do with race.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>It&#x2019;s unlikely King&#x2019;s amendment will become law, and it&#x2019;s also unlikely that anyone will miss him when he departs this earth.</p><p><em>Featured Image Via Public Domain</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
