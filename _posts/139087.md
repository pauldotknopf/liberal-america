<p>Donald Trump is a little bit impulsive, don&#x2019;t you think?</p><p>He says exactly what&#x2019;s going through his mind without taking a nanosecond to consider the consequences. Naturally, this leads to some awkward moments for him, but he brushes them off with accusations that his listener is at fault.</p><p>Remember when he was asked about <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan&apos;, &apos;KuKluxKlan&apos;);">KuKluxKlan</a> leader David Duke, and he <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-david-duke-amnesia/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-david-duke-amnesia/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t know anything about him.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Turned out that he did know a lot about Duke. He just forgot to think before he spoke.</p><p>It seems that impulsive nature of his shows up on Twitter, too.</p><p><a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/24/trump-tweet-brexit/#GD4NjOYP2sqK" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://mashable.com/2016/06/24/trump-tweet-brexit/#GD4NjOYP2sqK&apos;, &apos;Mashable&apos;);">Mashable</a> reports that as soon as&#xA0;Trump arrived in Scotland and learned about the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887&apos;, &apos;U.K.\&apos;s decision to leave the E.U&apos;);">U.K.&#x2019;s decision to leave the E.U</a>., he sent out a Tweet to congratulate them.</p><p>He <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/24/trump-tweet-brexit/#GD4NjOYP2sqK" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://mashable.com/2016/06/24/trump-tweet-brexit/#GD4NjOYP2sqK&apos;, &apos;wrote&apos;);">wrote</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!&#x201D;</em></p><p>Once again, impulsivity over fact checking.</p><p>Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the Union. Oops.</p><p>Donald&#x2019;s handlers had to move quickly to take down the tweet and try to save face. But not before a lot of Scots shared their reactions.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump&apos;, &apos;@realDonaldTrump&apos;);">@realDonaldTrump</a> Scotland voted IN you moron</p>

Fantastic!</p><p>There were many more, but most are inappropriate for this site.</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t the only way that Trump showed his lack of&#xA0;preparedness on his Scotland trip either. Knowing that he was going to arrive in the U.K. on the day after one of the most historic votes in its history, Trump didn&#x2019;t even travel with any of his foreign policy advisors. When asked about that by a reporter from MSNBC, Trump <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-discusses-golf-course-day-brexit-vote" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-discusses-golf-course-day-brexit-vote&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>&#xA0;he had:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;[&#x2026;]been in touch with them, but there&#x2019;s nothing to talk about.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Wait, what? Nothing to talk about?</p><p>In truth, of course, Trump had quite a lot to talk about, but it was all about himself and his wonderfulness. On the morning after what may very well be the vote that changes the entire structure of Europe, Donald Trump told the gathered press that his gold course is fabulous, that the suites in the lighthouse are terrific, and that he has the best properties anywhere.</p><p>He also pointed out that the monumental collapse of the British pound would mean <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-discusses-golf-course-day-brexit-vote" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-discusses-golf-course-day-brexit-vote&apos;, &apos;more of a profit for him&apos;);">more of a profit for him</a>.</p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2IrrIMwF0Rk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><em>Featured image via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuGhZ5Jb33g" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuGhZ5Jb33g&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);">YouTube</a> screengrab.</em></p>
