<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Donald Trump&#x2019;s (R-NY) journey to becoming the presumptive Republican nominee has hardly been politics as usual. Up until now, it has worked. But the blustery and divisive Trump is now&#xA0;at a disadvantage when it comes to&#xA0;getting ready for the general election, and he has no one to blame but himself.</p><p>Trump reached the number of primary votes needed for the nomination a full month before Hillary Clinton (D-NY) did. Instead of preparing for the final push this fall, he used his time to insult minority groups and&#xA0;hold rallies in less than competitive states.&#xA0;Now that Hillary has likely clinched the Democratic nomination, she has already pivoted to campaigning in swing states and focusing on her next opponent.</p><p>In the meantime, Trump&#x2019;s been calling everyone who confronts him with pesky facts a liar and making racist comments about&#xA0;a federal judge.</p><p>A quick look at Trump&#x2019;s May travel schedule says it all. Last month Trump campaigned in eight different states: West Virginia, Nebraska, Oregon, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, and California. All of those states have a known track record of being consistently red or blue during elections.</p><p>Former Mitt Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/06/19/482516936/how-donald-trump-may-have-wasted-a-monthlong-advantage-over-hillary-clinton" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.npr.org/2016/06/19/482516936/how-donald-trump-may-have-wasted-a-monthlong-advantage-over-hillary-clinton&apos;, &apos;NPR&apos;);" target="_blank">NPR</a>&#xA0;that this was not the smartest move:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The Trump campaign starts the general election at an organizational disadvantage&#x2026; This is a candidate who won by the sheer strength of his personality and bluster instead of through a well-organized campaign effort.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Trump seems to be grasping for anything positive, giving his utter fail on foreign policy issues after the Orlando shooting and GOP higher ups losing patience with his antics. On Friday he tweeted this picture of a survey:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THANK YOU! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmericaFirst?src=hash" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmericaFirst?src=hash&apos;, &apos;#AmericaFirst&apos;);">#AmericaFirst</a> <a href="https://t.co/qp07UfnnjM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/qp07UfnnjM&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/qp07UfnnjM&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/qp07UfnnjM</a></p>
