</div><p>Last month, I was stunned to learn that two girls graduating with my girlfriend&#x2019;s son are on their way to Bob Jones University in the fall. The principal reason for my concern?&#xA0;Even though an investigation revealed in <a href="http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2014/12/11/report-suggests-personnel-action-former-bju-president/20245969/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2014/12/11/report-suggests-personnel-action-former-bju-president/20245969/&apos;, &apos;scathing detail&apos;);">scathing detail</a> that BJU engaged in victim blaming and victim shaming of the worst type for years, the ultrafundamentalist school in Greenville, South Carolina has shown that it either <a href="http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2015/03/23/bju-faulted-response-grace-report/70349122/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2015/03/23/bju-faulted-response-grace-report/70349122/&apos;, &apos;cannot or will not&apos;);">cannot or will not</a> get its head out of the sand on this issue.</p><p>It initially appeared that things had finally changed when BJU&#xA0;<a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/25/university-know-predator-campus/">expelled senior Micah Pretlove</a> within hours of his arrest for two sexual assaults that took place while he was a student at BJU&#x2019;s affiliated private Christian school, Bob Jones Academy. But I recently learned something that suggests the rot still runs very deep.&#xA0;It turns out that BJA&#x2019;s principal&#xA0;is a close friend of the man responsible for introducing most of the nation to the culture of victim blaming that has long run rampant in the ultrafundamentalist world.</p><p>Not long after I told you about Pretlove, I was contacted by Karen Lee, the younger sister of BJA&#x2019;s administrator/principal, Dan Nelson. She told me that before arriving in Greenville in 2011, her brother was the principal of a Christian school in Indianapolis attached to a church pastored by Chuck Phelps.</p><p>For those who don&#x2019;t recall, Phelps is the central figure in <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/alleged-rapist-tina-anderson-girl-allegedly-forced-confess/story?id=13631339" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://abcnews.go.com/2020/alleged-rapist-tina-anderson-girl-allegedly-forced-confess/story?id=13631339&apos;, &apos;one of the most outrageous cases&apos;);">one of the most outrageous cases</a> of victim blaming ever uncovered. Back in 1997, Tina Anderson, one of his parishoners at Trinity Baptist Church in Concord, New Hampshire;&#xA0;told Phelps that <a href="http://livewire.wmur.com/Event/Victim_Takes_Stand_In_Willis_Rape_Trial?Page=0" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://livewire.wmur.com/Event/Victim_Takes_Stand_In_Willis_Rape_Trial?Page=0&apos;, &apos;she had been raped&apos;);">she had been raped</a> by fellow church member Ernie Willis. Phelps&#xA0;forced Anderson to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101226002837/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/woman-i-was-afraid-to-tell-of-rape" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://web.archive.org/web/20101226002837/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/woman-i-was-afraid-to-tell-of-rape&apos;, &apos;write a letter&apos;);">write a letter</a> apologizing for &#x201C;getting into a compromising situation,&#x201D; and then forced her to stand in front of the entire congregation while he read it.</p><p>She was then sent to Colorado, and kept quiet about her ordeal because she remembered how members of her church told her to keep quiet about being molested by another family member. There the matter stood until a former member of her church <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/alleged-rape-victim-accuses-trinity-baptist-church-deacon/story?id=10806348" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/alleged-rape-victim-accuses-trinity-baptist-church-deacon/story?id=10806348&apos;, &apos;spoke up about it&apos;);">spoke up about it</a> on Facebook in 2010. When Concord police learned about it, they got in touch with Anderson. By this time, she was no longer afraid of her former church, and agreed to press charges. Willis was convicted in 2011, and sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison. Phelps&#x2019; successor, Brian Fuller, <a href="http://www.tbcnh.org/media/tbc_pdf_docs/concord-monitor-06-15-2010.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;pageview&apos;, &apos;http://www.tbcnh.org/media/tbc_pdf_docs/concord-monitor-06-15-2010.pdf&apos;);">stated</a> soon after Anderson came forward that&#xA0;rape victims should never be forced to stand before the congregation in this manner.</p><p>Hearing this from Lee made me do a double take. But a peek at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nelson-70096046" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nelson-70096046&apos;, &apos;Nelson\&apos;s LinkedIn profile&apos;);">Nelson&#x2019;s LinkedIn profile</a> confirmed it.</p><div id="attachment_137414" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-137414" src="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-10-23.28.38.png?resize=480%2C800" alt="Screenshot from Dan Nelson&apos;s LinkedIn profile" srcset="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-10-23.28.38.png?resize=480%2C800 480w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-10-23.28.38.png?resize=480%2C800 50w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-10-23.28.38.png?resize=480%2C800 350w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>Before coming to BJA, Nelson was the principal/administrator of Colonial Christian School, an outreach of Colonial Hills Baptist Church in Indianapolis. Phelps has pastored that church since 2009. Lee told me that her brother and Phelps go back longer than that; their families have been friends for over four decades.</p><p>When Nelson moved to Greenville,&#xA0;Lee&#xA0;told him on Facebook Messenger that if any &#x201C;any kind of a coverup&#x201D; took place in Indianapolis,&#xA0;he needed to call the police right away. Nelson adamantly denied&#xA0;being part of any cover-up. He said that if anything did happen, he would respond to it in the same manner that he does to any situation&#x2013;&#x201C;consistently, biblically, and legally.&#x201D;</p><p>From the looks of it, Nelson didn&#x2019;t live up to his own standard. It is inconceivable that&#xA0;he&#xA0;didn&#x2019;t know about this story when it broke in 2010. What principal would even think about staying on the payroll of a pastor who not only shamed victims, but fostered an environment in which victims were told to keep quiet? I was even more outraged when Lee told me that her brother has four kids of his own&#x2013;all girls. Would he condone one of them&#xA0;being treated this way? I would have liked to get Nelson&#x2019;s side of this when I emailed him to find out how he responded when Pretlove molested a girl in 2013. However, he never responded.</p><p>As if this wasn&#x2019;t unnerving enough, I learned something else from Cathy Harris, a former BJU student who tried to tell administrators about being abused as a child&#x2013;only to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/education/christian-school-faulted-for-halting-abuse-study.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/education/christian-school-faulted-for-halting-abuse-study.html&apos;, &apos;told&apos;);">told</a> that she would be &#x201C;damaging the cause of Christ&#x201D; if she spoke up. Harris started a blog, Chuckles Travels, to turn the hot lights on Phelps after his involvement in this travesty came to light. Among other things, Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192156/http://chucklestravels.com/2012/10/09/who-was-the-special-speaker-for-todays-bob-jones-academy-chapel/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192156/http://chucklestravels.com/2012/10/09/who-was-the-special-speaker-for-todays-bob-jones-academy-chapel/&apos;, &apos;discovered&apos;);">discovered</a> that Phelps was the speaker at BJA&#x2019;s daily chapel on October 9, 2012.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Bear in mind, folks&#x2013;this was after Willis&#x2019; trial and conviction. Given that BJA&#x2019;s students were almost certainly aware of the trial and the events leading up to it, Nelson&#x2019;s decision to let Phelps speak was inexcusable. He was effectively telling&#xA0;BJA&#x2019;s students that victim blaming and victim shaming are acceptable.&#xA0;Imagine if Dan Turner, Brock Turner&#x2019;s father, had been allowed to speak at a school assembly.</p><p>Nelson and Phelps are still close friends&#xA0;on Facebook, per this screenshot of Nelson&#x2019;s friends list.</p><div id="attachment_137436" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-137436" src="//i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-11-01.13.47.png?resize=480%2C800" alt="Screenshot of Dan Nelson&apos;s friends list--&quot;Charles R Phelps&quot; is Chuck Phelps" srcset="//i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-11-01.13.47.png?resize=480%2C800 480w, //i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-11-01.13.47.png?resize=480%2C800 50w, //i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-11-01.13.47.png?resize=480%2C800 350w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>That sends a chill down my spine. You would think that Nelson would be doing everything he could to get BJU&#x2019;s head out of the sand, seeing that BJA is the largest pipeline to BJU. But apparently he isn&#x2019;t willing to let the best interests of his students come ahead of a decades-long friendship.</p><p>I&#x2019;d wondered what kind of parent would send their child to BJU. Well, now I have at least part of my answer&#x2013;parents who are willing to condone a victim-blaming lump of dung speaking to their children.</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
