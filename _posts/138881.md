</div><p>When a Baton Rouge woman caught her sons breaking into a neighbor&#x2019;s house, she reacted like any mother would&#x2013;she felt that she had to teach them a lesson. It&#x2019;s how she went about it that has her in hot water with Louisiana child welfare authorities and East Baton Rouge sheriff&#x2019;s deputies. They believe she <a href="http://www.wbrz.com/news/mom-thought-she-was-doing-the-right-thing-when-she-whipped-kids-who-broke-into-home/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wbrz.com/news/mom-thought-she-was-doing-the-right-thing-when-she-whipped-kids-who-broke-into-home/&apos;, &apos;crossed the line&apos;);">crossed the line</a> into child abuse.</p><p>On Friday, Schaquana Spears noticed&#xA0;her three teenage sons breaking into the home of <a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/16173825-129/baton-rouge-mother-jailed-in-beating-of-3-sons-after-she-caught-them-burglarizing-house-deputies-say" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://theadvocate.com/news/16173825-129/baton-rouge-mother-jailed-in-beating-of-3-sons-after-she-caught-them-burglarizing-house-deputies-say&apos;, &apos;their next-door neighbor&apos;);">their next-door neighbor</a>, Lisa Nicholson. They&#xA0;knocked out Nicholson&#x2019;s back window and stole&#xA0;a hoverboard, socks, and electronic equipment from Nicholson&#x2019;s son. They didn&#x2019;t get to enjoy their loot for long, however; Spears immediately ordered the items returned. By the end of the week, the boys were at a juvenile detention center.</p><p>However, Spears got a surprise on Tuesday when deputies showed up at her door with a warrant for her arrest. It turned out that her oldest son, a 13-year-old, had told sheriff&#x2019;s detectives that his mother had whipped him and his brothers with an electrical cord as punishment for the break-in. He had several cuts to his arms and marks across his leg, and some of the wounds were bleeding. His 12-year-old brother had cuts to the arms, while their 10-year-old brother had a scratch on his arm.</p><p>Spears was charged with two counts of child cruelty&#x2013;a move that has been roundly criticized both inside and outside Louisiana. Even the victim, Nicholson, claimed Spears shouldn&#x2019;t have been arrested. She believed that Spears was trying to save her boys from falling into a life of crime.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>&#x201C;If it was me,&#xA0;I&#x2019;m gonna beat you before I let the cops kill you. I&#x2019;m gonna do what I have to do. I&#x2019;m not gonna let (my children) steal and kill and do all of that. I&#x2019;m not gonna let them fall victim to the streets.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Spears was released <a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/police/16183302-123/its-been-hell-says-baton-rouge-mom-jailed-for-allegedly-beating-sons-after-catching-them-burglarizin" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://theadvocate.com/news/police/16183302-123/its-been-hell-says-baton-rouge-mom-jailed-for-allegedly-beating-sons-after-catching-them-burglarizin&apos;, &apos;later that night&apos;);">later that night</a> on $1,000 bond. It should have been $2,500, but a judge took pity on her and reduced the bond. A local bail bondswoman posted the entire bond out of her own pocket, though Spears&#xA0;could have gone home on her own recognizance. The boys are currently staying with their grandmother until Spears can regain custody.</p><p>A crew from&#xA0;WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge was <a href="http://www.wbrz.com/news/mother-arrested-after-whipping-her-3-sons-for-breaking-into-house/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wbrz.com/news/mother-arrested-after-whipping-her-3-sons-for-breaking-into-house/&apos;, &apos;waiting for Spears&apos;);">waiting for Spears</a> when she left the jail.

State treasurer John Kennedy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JohnKennedyLouisiana/posts/1048465785249831" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/JohnKennedyLouisiana/posts/1048465785249831&apos;, &apos;took to Facebook&apos;);">took to Facebook</a> to support Spears, saying that even with the arrest, &#x201C;I bet those boys won&#x2019;t be burglarizing other homes any time soon though.&#x201D; Former state senator Julie Quinn offered to represent Spears pro bono, saying that the decision to charge her was &#x201C;absurd.&#x201D; Kellee Michelle of Your Black World believes the arrest is evidence that &#x201C;<a href="http://yourblackworld.net/2016/06/22/this-is-why-america-is-jacked-up-baton-rouge-mother-should-be-applauded-not-arrested-for-punishing-her-3-sons-caught-burglarizing-a-home/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://yourblackworld.net/2016/06/22/this-is-why-america-is-jacked-up-baton-rouge-mother-should-be-applauded-not-arrested-for-punishing-her-3-sons-caught-burglarizing-a-home/&apos;, &apos;America is jacked up&apos;);">America is jacked up</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>With all due respect, the thing that&#x2019;s really jacked up is that Spears is being applauded.&#xA0;How can anyone read the descriptions of her sons&#x2019; wounds and think this was at all acceptable? Let&#x2019;s not sugarcoat things. Teenagers breaking into houses&#xA0;need&#xA0;a reality check. But beating your sons until they bleed is so far out of line that it&#x2019;s not even funny. This is really no different from what <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2014/09/16/adrian-peterson-did-commit-abuse-and-a-case-against-physical-punishment/">Adrian Peterson</a> did to his son two years ago.</p><p>Marketa Walters, Louisiana&#x2019;s Secretary of Children and Family Services, said as much in a <a href="http://www.wafb.com/story/32281122/dcfs-where-is-the-line-between-reasonable-discipline-and-child-abuse-" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wafb.com/story/32281122/dcfs-where-is-the-line-between-reasonable-discipline-and-child-abuse-&apos;, &apos;statement&apos;);">statement</a> about &#x201C;the line between reasonable discipline and child abuse.&#x201D; Without going into specifics on the case, Walters said that discipline goes too far when children are &#x201C;cut, burned, bloody, or bruised.&#x201D; Seen in that light, Nicholson&#x2019;s suggestion that it&#x2019;s better to beat your kids for breaking into a house rather than see them killed sends a chill down my spine.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>Spears thinks the only&#xA0;alternative would have been to <a href="http://www.wbrz.com/news/national-outcry-after-mom-arrested-for-whipping-child/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wbrz.com/news/national-outcry-after-mom-arrested-for-whipping-child/&apos;, &apos;do nothing&apos;);">do nothing</a>. Had that happened, she says she would have been branded &#x201C;unfit.&#x201D; No, Schaquana. You had an option. You could have made your boys take the stuff back, then drive them to the police station yourself.</p>
