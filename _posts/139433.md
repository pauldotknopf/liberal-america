<p>In April of last year, a young man named Freddie Gray was arrested by Baltimore Police, apparently without incident <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/05/02/top-baltimore-cop-in-freddie-grays-death-was-hospitalized-for-mental-health-issues-in-2012/">or injury</a>. He was taken by van to the Western District police station, with several stops along the way.</p><p>He was not secured in the van.&#xA0;Somewhere along the line, his spine was <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-freddie-gray-20150419-story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-freddie-gray-20150419-story.html&apos;, &apos;80 percent severed&apos;);">80 percent severed</a>.</p><p>After protests erupted in Baltimore, and amidst many steps and missteps by nearly every party involved in the arrest, death, and protest (<a href="http://data.baltimoresun.com/news/freddie-gray/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://data.baltimoresun.com/news/freddie-gray/&apos;, &apos;here is a timeline&apos;);">here is a timeline</a> to spark your memory), it was decided that the so-called &#x201C;Baltimore 6&#x201D; would stand trial.</p><p>The most serious charge was cast on the driver of the van, Officer Caesar Goodson, Jr., for allegedly giving Gray a &#x201C;rough ride&#x201D; on the way to the police station and failing to secure Gray in his seat.&#xA0;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Goodson was charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder.</span></p><p>On Thursday, Goodson was acquitted of all charges.</p><p>While any reasonable person would think this to be a time for solemn celebration for the police, considering it was all related to the tragic death of a young man who was under their protection, the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) thought they would go in a different direction.</p><p>They decided to offer a toast to the defense team for beating the charges, with no respect to the family and friends of Freddie Gray.</p><p>On a side note, this is exactly the reason why some people should not be allowed to use memes. They weren&#x2019;t even done yet. They next went after Marilyn Mosby, the City State&#x2019;s Attorney, who is prosecuting the Baltimore 6.</p><div id="attachment_139443" style="width: 644px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-139443 size-full" src="//i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/35AD789B00000578-0-image-m-109_1466919651159.jpg?resize=634%2C699" alt="Photo via Twitter: @FOP3" srcset="//i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/35AD789B00000578-0-image-m-109_1466919651159.jpg?resize=634%2C699 634w, //i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/35AD789B00000578-0-image-m-109_1466919651159.jpg?resize=634%2C699 64w, //i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/35AD789B00000578-0-image-m-109_1466919651159.jpg?resize=634%2C699 350w, //i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/35AD789B00000578-0-image-m-109_1466919651159.jpg?resize=634%2C699 600w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" data-recalc-dims="1">
