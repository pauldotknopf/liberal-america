<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>Question: Just how washed up and unpopular is Ted Nugent? Answer: A concert event in New Hampshire where he was the headline act <a href="http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper&apos;, &apos;had to reduce&apos;);" target="_blank">had to reduce</a> ticket prices from $67 to $5, and yet they still had trouble getting anyone to fork over five bucks.</p><p>The event, billed as &#x201C;Laconiafest,&#x201D; was held Friday night, and it was meant to serve as the beginning of Nugent&#x2019;s 2016&#xA0;Sonic Baptizm tour. But from the beginning, ticket sales were incredibly sluggish, and a band which was supposed to play the venue on Saturday cancelled due to lack of interest.</p><p>Yet in an interview after his show, <a href="http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper&apos;, &apos;Nugent spoke&apos;);" target="_blank">Nugent spoke</a> as if he&#x2019;d just played a gig in front of a stadium filled with cheering fans, commenting:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There sure were a gaggle of beautiful, sexy, skinny gals out there tonight and as always, it is incredibly inspiring to see everybody smiling and dancing to my songs. Tonight was an out of the park musical home run! Lucky, lucky me!&#x201D;</em></p><p>Adding insult to injury for the city of Laconia <a href="http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper&apos;, &apos;is the fact&apos;);" target="_blank">is the fact</a> that the concert promoters left town without bothering to pay their bills.</p><p>It should be noted that earlier in the week, when Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler and Brett Michaels of Poison played at Laconiafest, the crowds had been large. Apparently the reason for the lack of interest on Friday was due to the fact that no one wants to see a has-been like Nugent perform.</p><p>Nugent has not toured since 2014 (probably because no one is clamoring to see him), and that tour was also fraught with problems: Several&#xA0;venues <a href="http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/95694-laconia-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper&apos;, &apos;cancelled shows&apos;);" target="_blank">cancelled shows</a> after&#xA0;complaints about Nugent&#x2019;s&#xA0;racist comments. Nugent, always unwilling to accept responsibility for his actions, blamed the cancellations on:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Sick, sick, stoned, hygiene-challenged Michael Moore fans [who] call all the promoters, they call all the venues, they call all my sponsors, every day.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>Looks like karma has finally caught up with Ted Nugent. It was only a matter of time.</p>
