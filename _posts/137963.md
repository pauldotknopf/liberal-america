<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>In yet another sign that the Trump for President campaign is in total disarray, an &#x201C;emergency&#x201D; fundraising appeal was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html&apos;, &apos;sent out via email&apos;);" target="_blank">sent out via email</a> Saturday morning, practically begging supporters to raise $100,000 by midnight so Trump can run television ads to counter those running against him from Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The email <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html&apos;, &apos;begins&apos;);" target="_blank">begins</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Right now we&#x2019;re facing an emergency goal of $100,000 to help get our ads on the air. We need your contribution by 11:59 P.M. Tonight.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Crooked Hillary is about to invade your TV with ads attacking Mr. Trump. But we&#x2019;re preparing to fight back.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The ad also <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html&apos;, &apos;assures potential donors&apos;);" target="_blank">assures potential donors</a> that the campaign will be releasing anti-Clinton ads which focus on Benghazi and the FBI probe into the former Secretary of State&#x2019;s private email server.</p><p>What is most puzzling about this email seeking money is that Trump has often said he is self-financing his campaign. Doesn&#x2019;t he have $100,00 that he could give to the campaign so he can run ads? Also, how many ads does the campaign think they can buy for a mere 100K? Not many, and not in any large markets.</p><p>Trump is already being beaten in the areas of staffing, money, a ground game in key states, and advertising by a coordinated strategy from the Clinton camp, the DNC, and others who are running ads slamming Trump on television, radio, and the internet.</p><p>In recent weeks, some in the GOP <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/18/politics/donald-trump-emergency-fundraising/index.html&apos;, &apos;have expressed concern&apos;);" target="_blank">have expressed concern</a> that Trump and his campaign apparatus are woefully inadequate when it comes to battling the onslaught of negative media which is now being directed at the presumptive Republican nominee.</p><p>Lest we forget, here&#x2019;s Trump just last year bragging about how rich and successful he is:</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7fKmGoEL8M8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured Image Via <a href="http://By Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America - Donald Trump, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=47177845" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://By Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America - Donald Trump, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=47177845&apos;, &apos;Wikipedia&apos;);" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>&#xA0;</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
