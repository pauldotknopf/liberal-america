<p>Say hello to the first transgender woman to <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/29/transgender-woman-wins-democratic-senate-nomination-in-utah/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/29/transgender-woman-wins-democratic-senate-nomination-in-utah/&apos;, &apos;earn&apos;);" target="_blank">earn</a> a Congressional nomination in a major political party. Misty Snow just became the Utah Democrats&#x2019; nominee for the Senate. The fact that she is from Utah, a Mormon heavy state,&#xA0;makes her nomination&#xA0;even more amazing.</p><p>Go Utah&#x2026; Let&#x2019;s break the stereotypes!</p><p>Snow beat out her opponent, Mormon marriage therapist, Jonathan Swinton, by a 60 percent to 40 percent margin.</p><p>She had this to say about it on her <a href="http://www.mistyksnow.com/news/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mistyksnow.com/news/&apos;, &apos;website&apos;);" target="_blank">website</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There are some that claim that Utah is not ready for a candidate like me, but I strongly disagree. Utah is not only ready but in desperate need of a senator exactly like me. We cannot wait for others to give us equality. We have to claim equality for ourselves. I have the courage and fortitude to fight for economic prosperity and full equality under the law, and I will serve you well as Utah&#x2019;s next U.S. senator.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Utah is one of the most conservative states in the country. Over 60-percent of the population adheres to&#xA0;Mormonism, which has been&#xA0;openly anti-LGBT since its inception.</p><p>They have started making some small measures toward LGBT equality, but they have their own loopholes and&#xA0;one of those &#x201C;religious freedom&#x201D; laws giving religious people the right to discriminate.</p><p>Derek Kitchen, a member of the Salt Lake City Council,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/transgender-woman-elected-democrats-nominee-in-utah-senate-r?utm_term=.tvog6Zkrz#.xtg6xqW8p" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/transgender-woman-elected-democrats-nominee-in-utah-senate-r?utm_term=.tvog6Zkrz#.xtg6xqW8p&apos;, &apos;told&apos;);" target="_blank">told</a> Buzzfeed News:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Her Republican opponent has a tight grasp on the senate seat, but Misty will hopefully bring a new kind of conversation to the table.&#xA0;I&#x2019;m so thrilled that gender and sexuality are an afterthought in Utah politics, and I look forward to watching this race unfold. This is a dynamic time in political history, that&#x2019;s for sure, and I&#x2019;m so proud to bear witness to the changes.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This is a great thing to see. Hopefully, this will empower more trans people to participate in politics, and that the&#xA0;inclusion of trans people at&#xA0;the next&#xA0;election is a familiar sight.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6Vq-17dUDxI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
