In the class action lawsuit, Curt Schlesinger and Peter Lo Re v. Ticketmaster, Schlesinger accused Ticketmaster&#x2019;s pricing to be, &#x201C;deceptive and excessive.&#x201D; The case was settled recently in Los Angeles Superior Court.</p><p>Live Nation, Ticketmaster&#x2019;s&#x2019; parent company, is an international organization that has been leading in revenue for the last several years. Attendance to concerts and events have skyrocketed all over globe, giving Live Nation a handsome revenue increase.</p><p>In 2015 Rich Tullo, the director of research at Albert Fried &amp; Company, reported a 7.24 billion dollar revenue total for the entertainment company, a higher revenue than originally projected.</p><p>What does that mean for you? Ticketmaster has agreed, as part of the settlement, to issue free tickets and discounts on tickets to members who purchased between October 21, 1999 and February 27, 2013.</p><p>According to Ticketmaster&#x2019;s Ticket Code Dedicated Site Homepage, the vouchers were scheduled to hit accounts June 18th, but are explicitly explained to be used on a first come, first serve basis. Also, the tickets are good only for general admission to Live Nation events, and only for certain &#x201C;eligible&#x201D; concerts.</p><p>The list of concerts has not been finalized yet so the vouchers are currently unable to be used. According to one Liberal America writer, and Ticketmaster member:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;On most accounts, none of the actual codes are showing up yet, so they can&#x2019;t be used as of now. Only the list of the codes you will receive are showing. If you&#x2019;re eligible but your account says &#x201C;No Active Vouchers Available&#x201D; there is no organization you can call, but there&#x2019;s an automated&#xA0;line with recorded instructions you can call to get the mailing and email address to send an inquiry. That number is 877-317-9139.&#x201D;</em></p><p>In order to find out how many ticket vouchers you have received, log in to your Ticketmaster account and look for the link that says Active Vouchers. The vouchers you will receive should be listed there.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div id="attachment_138085" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/concerts.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-138085" src="http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/concerts.jpg?resize=377%2C332" alt="Image Via Buzzfeed" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/concerts.jpg?resize=377%2C332 377w, http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/concerts.jpg?resize=377%2C332 64w, http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/concerts.jpg?resize=377%2C332 350w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>

</div><p>&#xA0;</p><p>With summer in full swing, some free concert tickets don&#x2019;t sound too bad. Though you might not be sitting front row for Beyonce, unexpected free tickets to one of your other concert interests would be just as good.</p><p>For a news report about the settlement, see video below:</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DEjlQ4h73kI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Featured Image Via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ticketmaster/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=10150703098283641" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/Ticketmaster/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=10150703098283641&apos;, &apos;Ticketmaster Facebook&apos;);">Ticketmaster Facebook</a></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
