</div><p>Back in March, North Carolina&#x2019;s Republican-dominated&#xA0;General Assembly&#xA0;passed <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/03/23/public-safety-nc-repubs-finger-lgbt-residents/">one of the most outrageously anti-gay bills</a> in the nation. Now, in the face of unrelenting pressure, the legislature is <a href="http://www.wbtv.com/story/32326019/house-leadership-drafts-hb2-changes-amid-pressure-from-nba" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wbtv.com/story/32326019/house-leadership-drafts-hb2-changes-amid-pressure-from-nba&apos;, &apos;mulling changes&apos;);">mulling changes</a> to the bathroom bill.</p><p>WBTV in Charlotte got its hands on a draft bill crafted by the state house Republican leadership. Read it <a href="http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wbtv/pdf/HB2-draft-legislation-wbtv2.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;pageview&apos;, &apos;http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wbtv/pdf/HB2-draft-legislation-wbtv2.pdf&apos;);">here</a>. The draft&#xA0;would allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with whom they identify if they get a notarized statement from a doctor stating that he or she has undergone sex reassignment surgery. This would qualify a transgender person to get a &#x201C;certificate of sex reassignment,&#x201D; which would be considered the equivalent of a birth certificate.</p><p>The draft proposal would also amend the statewide nondiscrimination law included in the original bathroom bill&#x2013;or House Bill 2, as it is popularly called&#x2013;to reference federal statutes protecting certain classes of people. It would also&#xA0;create a state &#x201C;anti-discrimination task force&#x201D; that would advise the legislature on how to improve North Carolina&#x2019;s anti-discrimination laws.</p><p>Apparently, these changes didn&#x2019;t come without some prodding. According to WBTV, the NBA has&#xA0;been leaning pretty heavily on both the legislature and Governor Pat McCrory to amend HB2. Charlotte is scheduled to host the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, but has sent some very loud hints that it could move the game if the bathroom bill is still on the books in its current form. A person close to the discussions said that the NBA wants anyone who attends an NBA game to use &#x201C;the bathroom associated with their gender identity.&#x201D;</p><p>While the draft bill would apparently help Charlotte&#x2019;s case for going to the game,&#xA0;the most odious provision of the original bill remains untouched. Local governments would still be barred from passing their own nondiscrimination ordinances. Remember, HB2 was crafted specifically to derail a Charlotte ordinance that would have allowed transgender people to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. Additionally, it leaves people who can&#x2019;t afford to have sex reassignment surgery out in the cold.</p><p>Partly because of this, Democratic state representative Chris Sgro, who is also the executive director of Equality NC, slammed the proposal as inadequate.
