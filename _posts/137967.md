I&#x2019;m sure we all knew this was coming. The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is known for protesting funerals with their &#x201C;God Hates Fags&#x201D; signs. Of course they would protest at the funerals of the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. There were far too many cameras and members of the media present at the funerals of these victims for Westboro to miss the opportunity for attention.</p><p>At the same time, there was a very special <a href="http://accidentalbear.com/angels-being-made-to-block-westboro-baptist-churchs-protest-at-orlando-memorial/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://accidentalbear.com/angels-being-made-to-block-westboro-baptist-churchs-protest-at-orlando-memorial/&apos;, &apos;anti-protest&apos;);" target="_blank">anti-protest</a> going on. Three organizations have teamed up to provide linen angel costumes for actors to wear at the counter-protest:&#xA0;&#x201C;American Theatre,&#x201D;<em>&#xA0;</em>the&#xA0;&#x201C;Orlando Shakespeare Theater,&#x201D;<em>&#xA0;</em>and<em>&#xA0;</em>the Angel Action Wings Project. A group of actors wore massive angel wings and stood together&#xA0;to block a 40-person group from Westboro Baptist&#x2019;s hatred.</p><p>The counter-protesters wore their angel costumes proudly and sang &#x201C;Amazing Grace&#x201D; to the WBC a**holes on the other side of the street. Eventually, the 40-person WBC group left.</p><p>These are just a taste of the disgusting things that the WBC is tweeting in the aftermath of this shooting:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">God hates fags.<br>God sent the shooter.<br>God hates murderer Omar Mateen.<br>Omar Mateen &amp; slain fags are in hell.<br>REPENT! <a href="https://t.co/XwkX7jGYpp" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/XwkX7jGYpp&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/XwkX7jGYpp&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/XwkX7jGYpp</a></p>
