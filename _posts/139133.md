<p>Remember Donald Trump bragging about never having to do any fundraising for his campaign? Well, maybe he should have, at least to practice for the day he was&#xA0;<a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/21/trump-campaign-nearly-broke-getting-crushed-clinton-machine/">broke</a> and needed the money.&#xA0;You&#x2019;d think after <a href="https://extremeliberal.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/donald-trump-filed-for-bankruptcy-twice-spread-the-word/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://extremeliberal.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/donald-trump-filed-for-bankruptcy-twice-spread-the-word/&apos;, &apos;five&apos;);">five</a> bankruptcies he&#x2019;d see it&#xA0;coming.</p><p>Email is a very important tool for generating donations, and most political campaigns use it.</p><p>According to <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-camp-donations-emails/304454/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-camp-donations-emails/304454/&apos;, &apos;AdAge&apos;);">AdAge</a>, Trump said that he would begin accepting donations for his general election campaign in early May. The only problem is that an unusually high percentage of Trump&#x2019;s campaign correspondence has been marked as spam, even before any email donation requests have gone out.</p><p>Nearly 8-percent of the emails were marked as spam, compared to likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s emails, of which none were deemed spam.</p><p>On Tuesday, June 21, Trump&#x2019;s campaign sent what it said was its <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&apos;, &apos;first&apos;);">first</a> fundraising email:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;This is the first fundraising email I have ever sent on behalf of my campaign. That&#x2019;s right. The FIRST ONE.&#x201D;</em></p><p>One day later Trump signed another email missive from the campaign, claiming that the fundraiser had broken fundraising records, apparently something his father had forecasted.</p><p>The next day, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&apos;, &apos;AdAge&apos;);">AdAge</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The campaign raised $3.3 million on Tuesday and $3.4 million yesterday.&#x201D;</em></p><p>These are impressive figures, but how much was actually donated through the emails? According to Hicks:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Only a portion of that was via email marketing and the remainder is attributed to online donations.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Yes, because <em>60-percent</em> of those first-ever fundraiser emails never reached inboxes. 60-percent!</p><p>Email tracking firm <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&apos;, &apos;Return Path&apos;);">Return Path</a> has measured the open rate by using estimates based on its panel of 2.5 million active email users.</p><p>Most of Trump&#x2019;s fundraising emails were automatically relegated to a recipient&#x2019;s spam folder, and moreover, only 12-percent of recipients opened the email, while 6-percent deleted it without reading it.</p><p>The reason most of the emails ended up in spam could be because they were sent from a different domain instead of one the campaign had used in the past. According to the senior director of research at <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&apos;, &apos;Return Path&apos;);">Return Path</a>, Tom Sather:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Since it&#x2019;s a new domain he&#x2019;s being penalized [&#x2026;] These are things that professional email marketers prepare for.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Well, Donald Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/politics/corey-lewandowski-out-as-trump-campaign-manager/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/politics/corey-lewandowski-out-as-trump-campaign-manager/&apos;, &apos;fired&apos;);">fired</a> his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday June 21, the day before the fundraising emails went out.</p><p>On the other hand, Return Path&#x2019;s <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/trump-s-fundraising-email-a-60-spam-rate/304673/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&apos;, &apos;data&apos;);">data</a> shows no evidence of any testing or segmentation before sending out the email campaign either.</p><p>Clinton&#x2019;s campaign sent out 658 different email variations, none of which got the spam label. Trump&#x2019;s campaign appears to be only segmenting by <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/03/14/the-geography-of-trumpism-where-do-they-come-from/">geography</a> when promoting campaign rallies in certain regions.
