Between his ignorance, racism, sexism, lies&#x2014;it&#x2019;s hard to know where to start.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Today I want to focus on one lie that helps sum up what Donald Trump is all about: his taxes.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The Massachusetts Senator then proceeds to verbally dissect Trump, looking into the camera and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moveon/videos/10153533408700493/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/moveon/videos/10153533408700493/&apos;, &apos;declaring&apos;);" target="_blank">declaring</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know what Trump pays in taxes because he is the first Presidential nominee in 40 years to refuse to disclose his tax returns. Maybe he&#x2019;s just a lousy businessman who doesn&#x2019;t want you to find out that he&#x2019;s worth a lot less money than he claims&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t know for sure. But, here&#x2019;s what we do know. The last time his taxes were made public, Donald Trump paid nothing in federal taxes&#x2014;ZERO. Zero taxes before, and for all we know he&#x2019;s paying zero taxes today. And he&#x2019;s proud of it. A few weeks ago he said he&#x2019;s more than happy to dodge taxes because he doesn&#x2019;t want to throw his money &#x2018;down the drain.&apos;&#x201D;</em></p><p>Warren ends her brief video by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moveon/videos/10153533408700493/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/moveon/videos/10153533408700493/&apos;, &apos;urging every American&apos;);" target="_blank">urging every American</a> to learn the truth about the presumptive GOP nominee:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Whatever Donald Trump says, whatever scam he tries to pull, whatever disgusting thing he thinks he can say because he&#x2019;s Donald Trump &#x2014; speak out. Talk to the person behind you in the grocery store. Talk to the person pumping gas next to you. And yes, share this video with your friends. Ask your Fox News-loving Republican uncle: Why do you pay your taxes but Donald Trump doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201D;</em></p><p>Watch the video for yourself.
