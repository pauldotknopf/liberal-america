<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>For over a year now, we&#x2019;ve heard the constant campaign applause line from Donald Trump (R-N.Y.) and his supporters that he&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/04/01/lying-donald-trump-made-71-things-up-in-only-one-hour/">self-funding</a> his campaign, and won&#x2019;t owe anything to lobbyists if he wins.</p><p>That sounds awesome, right? Finally, a president who&#xA0;won&#x2019;t be bought and paid for when he takes office. Finally, a president who&#xA0;can make decisions based on what&#x2019;s best for America, not what&#x2019;s best for the rich and powerful.</p><p>Finally, a president who&#xA0;will bring in the best people because he knows the best people and the best people will be the best people in the best group of people.</p><p>All hail the Donarchy!</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/STnqgejKIVM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>It sounds great, but Mr. Trump has been called on this several times. Experts continually point out that he was simply giving himself a loan from his own personal funds, which he can then pay back through donations, making his advertisement&#xA0;misleading at best.</p><p>Now Mr. Trump has another problem.</p><p>When he pushed the &#x201C;self-funded campaign&#x201D; button throughout the primaries, the truth is that he actually did have the liquid cash to fund his campaign, and he&#x2019;s loaned himself <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/21/pants-fire-trump-lied-money-raised-vets-made-no-donation/">about</a> $35 million so far. He never expected to get past the early primaries.</p><p>Heading into a general election, that self-funding motto will likely break from the need for excessive cash demanded by a campaign of this size.</p><p>In the past, GOP candidates who&#xA0;win the nomination typically have a group of large donors and lobbyists who&#xA0;need very little wooing, along with substantial resources provided by the Republican National Committee (RNC).</p><p>One of those resources is a list of names and phone numbers of people with money; the money Mr. Trump will need if he plans on running a general election campaign at this level.</p><p>In that spirit, the RNC recently provided Mr. Trump with a small list to get him dialing for dollars. According to the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-republican-national-committee-224403" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-republican-national-committee-224403&apos;, &apos;Politico report&apos;);"><em>Politico</em> report</a>, Trump wasn&#x2019;t havin&#x2019; it:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;While Trump had promised Priebus that he would call two dozen top GOP donors, when RNC chief of staff Katie Walsh recently presented Trump with a list of more than 20 donors, he called only three before stopping, according to two sources familiar with the situation. It&#x2019;s unclear whether he resumed the donor calls later.&#x201D;</em></p><p>When Trump&#x2019;s campaign <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trumps-fundraising-problem" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trumps-fundraising-problem&apos;, &apos;declined to comment&apos;);">declined to comment</a> on the calls, it became clear that this was as far as Trump planned on dialing. As non-traditional as his campaign has been, it&#x2019;s unlikely that he&#x2019;ll be able to buck tradition to such an extent that he won&#x2019;t need the RNC at some point.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>It appears that Trump&#x2019;s fundraising ability mirrors his general ability to make friends; a combination that could make it quite difficult to raise the more than $1 billion that will likely be necessary to compete into September and October.</p><p>The bigger problem for Mr. Trump is how he plans to explain it to his supporters. As they continue to chant that they&#x2019;re candidate is self-funded and above the fray, Mr. Trump finds himself needing to jump into the fray with everyone else.</p><p>Want to know the truth behind Trump&#x2019;s self-funding claims?
