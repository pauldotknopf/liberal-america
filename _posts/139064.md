<p>A new Reuters/Ipsos <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0ZA3KG" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0ZA3KG&apos;, &apos;weekly tracking poll&apos;);" target="_blank">weekly tracking poll</a> is showing a trend which could well continue for the remainder of the 2016 campaign: After narrowing the lead of Hillary Clinton to single digits last week, Donald Trump once again finds himself trailing the presumptive Democratic nominee by a 13 percentage points.</p><p>The June 20-24 poll shows that 46.6 percent of likely American voters support Clinton. 33.3 percent support Trump, and &#xA0;20.1 percent say they will not support either of the nominees.</p><p>Shortly after the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Trump had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0ZA3KG" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0ZA3KG&apos;, &apos;briefly narrowed the gap&apos;);" target="_blank">briefly narrowed the gap</a> with Clinton, cutting her lead to nine points. But since then, Clinton has been steadily increasing her support as voters remain uncomfortable with many of the things Trump has said and advocated as the solution to the problems which confront the nation.</p><p>This was also a bad week for the Trump campaign from another perspective: Money. In FEC filings, Trump disclosed that his campaign has a mere $1.3 million cash on hand. In contrast, Clinton reported a whopping $42.5 million in campaign cash. She also has ten times more campaign staffers and volunteers working for her than Trump does.</p><p>As if all this news isn&#x2019;t ominous enough for Trump, GOP campaign operatives are also actively working on a strategy which would unbind all of the currently bound delegates to the Republican convention, thereby allowing delegates to deny Trump the nomination and choose another candidate they feel has a better chance of competing against Clinton in the November general election.</p><p>Additionally, both Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said this week that&#xA0;Republicans should follow their &#x201C;conscience&#x201D; when they&#xA0;make their whether or not to support Donald Trump as the nominee of the GOP.</p>
