<p>Just last week I reported that Trump&#x2019;s campaign may be too <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/20/new-york-times-trump-may-be-too-broke-to-campaign/" target="_blank">broke</a> to continue. They only have $1.3 million on hand and&#xA0;they may not be able to afford TV advertisements until mid-July.</p><p>The Trump family must be getting desperate. One of Trump&#x2019;s children <a href="http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/06/28/27222/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/06/28/27222/&apos;, &apos;actually asked&apos;);" target="_blank">actually asked</a> a Scottish politician for money to help the campaign. Not only is it highly illegal for foreign nationals to donate to American campaigns, it makes the Trump campaign look really bad.</p><p>This law <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-is-spamming-scottish-mps-with-fundraising-emails-which-isnt-even-legal/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-is-spamming-scottish-mps-with-fundraising-emails-which-isnt-even-legal/&apos;, &apos;makes&apos;);" target="_blank">makes</a> the donation illegal:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;<a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/foreign.shtml" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/foreign.shtml&apos;, &apos;The Federal Election Campaign Act&apos;);" target="_blank">The Federal Election Campaign Act</a> (FECA) prohibits any foreign national from contributing, donating or spending funds in connection with any federal, state, or local election in the United States, either directly or indirectly. It is also unlawful to help foreign nationals violate that ban or to solicit, receive or accept contributions or donations from them. Persons who knowingly and willfully engage in these activities may be subject to fines and/or imprisonment.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Donald Trump, Jr. has been asking many politicians in Scotland for money. One Member of Parliament (MP), Natalie McGarry, responded with this email.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">May be Donald Trump bought lists &#x2013; bizarre for grassroots campaign &#x2013; but how does he opt out of foreign donations? <a href="https://t.co/jVwfdFnI6U" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/jVwfdFnI6U&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/jVwfdFnI6U&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/jVwfdFnI6U</a></p>

Given his rhetoric on migrants, refugees and immigration, it seems quite extraordinary that he would be asking foreign nationals for money; especially people who view his dangerous divisiveness with horror.&#x201D;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The thought of his reactionary type of politics and apparent ignorance of world affairs having access to a seat at the world table is both surreal, and terrifying. The above is a long way to say No, and do not contact me again.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Donald Trump was in Scotland recently promoting his golf course, which everyone hates.&#xA0;David Milne, a Scottish resident who lives near the golf course, <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/02/17/trump-scotland-golf-course-resentment/" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;He promises the Earth and delivers nothing. As far as that goes, he&#x2019;s in a good position to be a politician. But as far as the real world goes, no. Do not trust this man with anything.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Here is a news clip about Trump&#x2019;s campaign &#x201C;self-funding:&#x201D;</p>
