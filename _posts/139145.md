<p>Rebecca Landis Hayes was returning from running errands at the Harris Teeter store in her hometown of Concord, North Carolina. That&#x2019;s when she noticed a note on her car. She had left her car in designated veteran parking.</p><p>Hayes quickly took to Facebook to issue an apology of sorts to the anonymous note writer. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208865722136827&amp;set=a.1695998156281.2097176.1127641301&amp;type=3&amp;theater" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208865722136827&amp;set=a.1695998156281.2097176.1127641301&amp;type=3&amp;theater&apos;, &apos;She wrote&apos;);">She wrote</a>:</p><p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 30px"><em>&#x201C;To the person who left this note on my windshield today at the Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord, NC:&#xA0;</em></p><p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 30px"><em>I know I parked in one of the Veteran Parking spaces today, it was hot. I had been in and out of my car several times already this afternoon, and I was only going to be a minute. Besides, the parking lot was full, so I just did it. It was the first time, and I won&#x2019;t do it again. I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2026;</em></p><p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 30px"><em>I&#x2019;m sorry that you can&#x2019;t see my eight years of service in the United States Navy. I&#x2019;m sorry that your narrow misogynistic worldview can&#x2019;t conceive of the fact that there are female Veterans. I&#x2019;m sorry that I have to explain myself to people like you. Mostly, I&#x2019;m sorry that we didn&#x2019;t get a chance to have this conversation face to face, and that you didn&#x2019;t have the integrity and intestinal fortitude to identify yourself, qualities the military emphasizes.</em></p><p style="text-align: center"><em>Which leads to one question, I served, did you?&#x201D;<br>
</em></p><p>The note and Hayes&#x2019; reaction was posted to Facebook on June 13 and has generated over 12,800 shares and counting. Hayes used this interaction to remind Americans everywhere that while the military is made up of a diverse body of people, they share some common ideals.</p><p>She also told the <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/21/embarrassed-busybody-apologizes-to-female-veteran-after-accusing-her-of-parking-spot-abuse/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/21/embarrassed-busybody-apologizes-to-female-veteran-after-accusing-her-of-parking-spot-abuse/&apos;, &apos;Daily Caller&apos;);">Daily Caller</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px">&#x201C;<em>I would just like for people to understand that our armed forces are a diverse group that can not be stereotyped and the only thing we have in common is our love for our country and our willingness to defend our Constitution.</em>&#x201D;</p><p>Speaking with Today News, Hayes added why it&#x2019;s important not to stereotype and how this issue is larger than simple gender bias <a href="http://www.today.com/news/female-navy-vet-gets-apology-after-being-shamed-using-veterans-t100096" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.today.com/news/female-navy-vet-gets-apology-after-being-shamed-using-veterans-t100096&apos;, &apos;by saying&apos;);">by saying</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px">&#x201C;<em>There&#x2019;s been a lot of talk about people with disabilities in general parking in handicapped spots getting nasty looks or notes because people assume that in order to be handicapped people need to be in a wheelchair or look a certain way.</em>&#x201C;</p><p>According to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-navy-veteran-parking-note_us_5760b2abe4b09c926cfd8c4b" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-navy-veteran-parking-note_us_5760b2abe4b09c926cfd8c4b&apos;, &apos;Huffington Post&apos;);">Huffington Post</a>, she went on to remind us that despite some people&#x2019;s beliefs, women can and do serve in the military:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px">&#x201C;<em>I felt disappointed that in 2016, my being a female somehow meant I couldn&#x2019;t be a veteran.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Since Hayes&#x2019; note went viral she has received an apology which she posted to her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208922587878435&amp;set=a.1695998156281.2097176.1127641301&amp;type=3&amp;theater" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208922587878435&amp;set=a.1695998156281.2097176.1127641301&amp;type=3&amp;theater&apos;, &apos;Facebook&apos;);">Facebook</a> on June 20.</p><div id="attachment_138904" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-138904 size-large" src="//i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13465948_10208922587878435_3199584577038032437_n-600x800.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="Veteran" srcset="//cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13465948_10208922587878435_3199584577038032437_n.jpg 600w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13465948_10208922587878435_3199584577038032437_n.jpg 64w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13465948_10208922587878435_3199584577038032437_n.jpg 350w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13465948_10208922587878435_3199584577038032437_n.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1">
