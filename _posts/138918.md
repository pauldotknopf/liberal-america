<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Late President Ronald Reagan did not care much for Donald Trump during his presidency.</p><p>The Washington Post reports that Trump tried gaining influence with Reagan on multiple occasions, only to be shown the cold shoulder.</p><p>Records from the Reagan presidential library tells the story of how the Trump invited both President Reagan and the First Lady Nancy Reagan to his Atlantic City casino for a concert. The billionaire also invited the Reagans to his private home in Florida named &#x201C;Mar-a-Lago,&#x201D; which Trump described as a &#x201C;southern White House.&#x201D;</p><p>Reports show that the First Lady crossed out a line in her letter declining Trump&#x2019;s invitation which read, &#x201C;I am familiar with Mar-a-Lago.&#x201D;</p><p>In 1987 Trump contacted President Reagan trying to persuade him to name Paula Hawkins, a former Republican Senator from Flordia, as Secretary of Transportation. Reagan ignored his advice and picked Jim Burnley.</p><p>Most people may not know about Trump&#x2019;s earliest presidential aspirations. According to library records, the billionaire was exploring a presidential candidacy in 1987. He flew out to New Hampshire and invested $100,000 in newspaper advertisements which criticized Reagan&#x2019;s foreign policies. One memorable line from the Ads <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with America&#x2019;s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can&#x2019;t cure.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The ads also contained language that would sound very familiar to Americans following Trump&#x2019;s current campaign. Trump <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/&apos;, &apos;wrote&apos;);">wrote</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The world is laughing at America&#x2019;s politicians as we protect ships we don&#x2019;t own, carrying oil we don&#x2019;t need, destined for allies who won&#x2019;t help,&#x201D; they stated. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not let our great country be laughed at anymore.&#x201D;</em></p><p>During the same year, Trump was very close to headlining a very important Democratic fundraiser in New York City. After hearing the news, Frank J. Donatelli, political director for the Reagan administration, contacted White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker with a written request.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It would be most helpful if you would place a phone call to Don Trump today,&#x201D; Donatelli <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/&apos;, &apos;wrote&apos;);">wrote</a> in a memo to Baker. &#x201C;He has a large ego and would be responsive to your call.&#x201D;</em></p><p>According to reports, The word &#x201C;large&#x201D; was underlined for emphasis on the letter. Archives show that Trump did not attend the event.</p><p>Donatelli, who now works as the current chair of the Reagan Ranch Board of Governors, informed the post that despite the comparisons being made between Trump and Reagan, the two men &#x201C;could not be more different.&#x201D;</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;&#x2018;Reagan was a small government conservative with definite and long-held public policy views,&#x2019; <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/revealed-reagan-white-house-constantly-brushed-off-trump-and-his-large-ego-in-the-80s/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a> Donatelli, a former Republican National Committee deputy chair. &#x2018;Mr. Trump&#x2019;s views seem far more impressionistic. Most important, Reagan&#x2019;s good humor and optimism gave the public reassurance that he could and would effectively manage the vast powers of the presidency. That&#x2019;s a test that every presidential candidate has to pass.&apos;&#x201D;</em></p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vYmk8_THYXg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Featured Image Screengrab via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHBpXLum390" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHBpXLum390&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);">YouTube</a>.</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
