<p>Donald Trump has given new meaning to the word &#x201C;muddled.&#x201D; He doesn&#x2019;t seem to be able to make a single&#xA0;direct statement.</p><p>In my former life, I was a speech/language pathologist. I used to evaluate expressive language. I can tell you that virtually every comment made by Donald Trump shows a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/09/15/3701215/donald-trump-talks-funny-2/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/09/15/3701215/donald-trump-talks-funny-2/&apos;, &apos;frightening lack of clarity&apos;);">frightening lack of clarity</a>. He repeats himself, attempts to repair his thoughts, interrupts himself, and interjects meaningless words and phrases.</p><p>What is even more alarming is that his thinking&#xA0;seems to be no clearer than his speech.</p><p>Trump is famous for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/31/politics/donald-trump-positions-flip-flops/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/31/politics/donald-trump-positions-flip-flops/&apos;, &apos;changing his positions&apos;);">changing his positions</a> on key issues. Whether it&#x2019;s single payer health care, abortion, or&#xA0;the Clintons, he changes his mind over and over again.</p><p>Now Trump is trying to repair and revise his&#xA0;ugly promise to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/&apos;, &apos;ban all Muslims&apos;);">ban all Muslims</a> from the United States.</p><p><a href="http://addictinginfo.org/2016/06/25/trump-fixes-his-muslim-ban-somehow-makes-it-even-worse-tweets/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://addictinginfo.org/2016/06/25/trump-fixes-his-muslim-ban-somehow-makes-it-even-worse-tweets/&apos;, &apos;Addicting Info&apos;);">Addicting Info</a> is reporting that CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond talked to Trump in Scotland and tweeted out the candidate&#x2019;s new position.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hope Hicks then confirmed to me Trump indeed no longer supports his blanket Muslim ban. He only wants to ban Muslims from terror states /4</p>

He&#x2019;s not going to ban all Muslims from traveling here. He&#x2019;s only going to ban the ones from &#x201C;terror states.&#x201D;</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the problem, though.</p><p>Which terror states?</p><p>A look at the <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm&apos;, &apos;State Department website&apos;);">State Department website</a>&#xA0;shows that only 3 countries are designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Those countries are Syria, Iran, and Sudan.</p><p>Would&#xA0;that mean Muslims from <a href="http://www.criticalthreats.org/yemen" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.criticalthreats.org/yemen&apos;, &apos;Yemen&apos;);">Yemen</a>&#xA0;and <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/terrorist-sponsors-saudi-arabia-pakistan-china" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/terrorist-sponsors-saudi-arabia-pakistan-china&apos;, &apos;Saudi Arabia&apos;);">Saudi Arabia</a> will be welcome by Trump?</p><p>Would Christians from Sudan be allowed in? What about refugees? What if a Muslim was living in Scotland but had been born in Afghanistan?</p><p>What the heck does he mean when he says he&#x2019;ll be &#x201C;so vigilant&#x201D; with them?</p><p>Don&#x2019;t look for clarity from the ever-rambling, bumbling Mr. Trump.
