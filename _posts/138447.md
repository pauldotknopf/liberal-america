Let&#x2019;s have a look at some of her controversial claims;</p><ul>
<li>HPV vaccines increases the risk of &#x201C;mental retardation&#x201D; in young girls. Bachmann appears to have based this &#x201C;scientific&#x201D; theory on the following <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2011/09/bachmann-on-hpv-vaccine-mental-retardation-a-very-real-concern/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2011/09/bachmann-on-hpv-vaccine-mental-retardation-a-very-real-concern/&apos;, &apos;event&apos;);">event</a>:</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I will tell you that I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Fla., after the debate. She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter.&#x201D;</em></p><ul>
<li>Hezbollah plans to create missile sites in Cuba. Bachmann may have based her fear on unsubstantiated <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2011/09/bachmann-warns-of-hezbollah-missile-sites-cuba/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2011/09/bachmann-warns-of-hezbollah-missile-sites-cuba/&apos;, &apos;reports&apos;);">reports</a> by the Italian publication,&#xA0;<em>Corriere della Sera,</em> when she addressed her supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa:</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Why would you normalize trade with a country that sponsors terror? There is reports that have come out that Cuba has been working with another terrorist organization called Hezbollah. And Hezbollah is looking at wanting to be part of missile sites in Iran and, of course, when you are 90 miles offshore from Florida, you don&#x2019;t want to entertain the prospect of hosting bases or sites where Hezbollah could have training camps or perhaps have missile sites or weapons sites in Cuba.&#x201D;</em></p><ul>
<li>Gays are part of Satan is Bachman&#x2019;s firm stand on homosexuality. The gay and lesbian lifestyle is very dangerous, as she explained in a <a href="http://gawker.com/5820706/michele-bachmann-in-her-own-words-gays-are-part-of-satan" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://gawker.com/5820706/michele-bachmann-in-her-own-words-gays-are-part-of-satan&apos;, &apos;lecture&apos;);">lecture</a> she delivered to the National Education Leadership Conference back in 2004;</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Any of you who have members of your family that are in the lifestyle-we have a member of our family that is. This is not funny. It&#x2019;s a very sad life. It&#x2019;s part of Satan, I think, to say this is gay. It&#x2019;s anything but gay.&#x201D;</em></p><p>A few names down on Trump&#x2019;s list we find Texas-based televangelist Kenneth Copeland. This may be a surprising choice, especially since God previously told him that <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/kenneth-copeland-declares-ted-cruz-has-been-called-and-anointed-god-be-next-president" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/kenneth-copeland-declares-ted-cruz-has-been-called-and-anointed-god-be-next-president&apos;, &apos;Ted Cruz&apos;);">Ted Cruz</a> would be the next President of the United States.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Maybe he made it onto the list because of their shared anti-vaccine conspiracy theories? Unfortunately, Copeland&#x2019;s un-vaccinated congregation suffered a <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-vaxxer-donald-trump-could-learn-televangelist-pals-measles-outbreak" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-vaxxer-donald-trump-could-learn-televangelist-pals-measles-outbreak&apos;, &apos;measles&apos;);">measles</a> outbreak in 2013 and had to pay dearly for their leader&#x2019;s ideas.</p><p>Just like American voters may have to pay dearly for Trump&#x2019;s swivelling ideas put into action should he become our next president, one might add.</p><p>Televangelist James Dobson is another name on the list, and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Fkkk_f0ek" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Fkkk_f0ek&apos;, &apos;video&apos;);">video</a> from a speech shows clearly what he&#x2019;s all about, and sums up nicely the caliber of Trump&#x2019;s evangelical advisory board:</p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q3Fkkk_f0ek" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
