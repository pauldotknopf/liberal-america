Freddie Gray was arrested in his West Baltimore neighborhood on Arpil 12, 2015 for making eye contact with the police and attempting to run away. While a knife was found in his possession, that knife was ruled to be legal under Maryland law.</p><p>Officer Caesar Goodson, who will receive a verdict tomorrow, was driving the van&#xA0;in which&#xA0;Freddie Gray suffered a&#xA0; spinal injury. Officer Goodson did not follow standard police protocol by securing Freddie Gray into the van with a seat belt. Claims have been made that the Officer purposefully gave Freddie Gray a &#x201C;<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-gray-rough-rides-20150423-story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-gray-rough-rides-20150423-story.html&apos;, &apos;rough ride&apos;);">rough ride</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>The jurors have been presented with video footage of the police van veering between lanes. It was during this alleged rough ride that Freddie Gray, only 25 years old, suffered a spinal cord injury. His pleas for medical attention were not addressed in a timely manner, and Freddie Gray passed away from his<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/24/leaked-autopsy-finds-freddie-gray-suffered-high-energy-injury/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/24/leaked-autopsy-finds-freddie-gray-suffered-high-energy-injury/&apos;, &apos; injuries&apos;);"> injuries</a> a week later in the hospital.</p><p>The details of this case are disturbing, but the reactions have also been heartbreaking. Protests were held for Freddie Gray, and unfortunately, some of them turned violent. That violence and unrest led to fires, looting, a state imposed curfew, and a state of emergency being declared in Baltimore.</p><p>Many activists have responded in a much more appropriate way than looting or rioting. Many activists have taken to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Justice4FreddieGray/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/Justice4FreddieGray/&apos;, &apos;social media&apos;);">social media</a> to share their thoughts about how this case highlights the Black Lives Matters movement in online discussions.</p><p>Police officers have also been very passionate in their opinions on this subject, and many of them have responded with the hashtag <a href="https://www.facebook.com/700835273359194/photos/a.700839256692129.1073741828.700835273359194/858413144268072/?type=3&amp;theater" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/700835273359194/photos/a.700839256692129.1073741828.700835273359194/858413144268072/?type=3&amp;theater&apos;, &apos;#bluelivesmatter&apos;);">#bluelivesmatter</a>. It&#x2019;s coined after the <a href="https://www.policeone.com/police-heroes/articles/169534006-The-thin-blue-line-A-symbol-of-heroism-not-corruption/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.policeone.com/police-heroes/articles/169534006-The-thin-blue-line-A-symbol-of-heroism-not-corruption/&apos;, &apos;thin blue line&apos;);">thin blue line</a>, a symbol that represents solidarity in police culture.&#xA0; Some argue that the thin blue line breeds corruption; they say that the idea that police need to always stand together discourages police from holding each other accountable for unethical behaviors. Still, others claim that the thin blue line is a show of support in a job where one is not certain to come home to their family at the end of the day.</p><p>I support police officers, and am grateful for the sacrifices they make for us, but I hope they will hold each other to high standards. I hope that when a police officer sees an unethical behavior from a co-worker they will feel an obligation to report that behavior. I support police and their need to support each other so long as that support is not unconditional.</p><p>There is a countdown on social media referring to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/supportthebaltimoresix/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/supportthebaltimoresix/&apos;, &apos;Baltimore 6&apos;);">Baltimore 6</a>. The Baltimore 6 refers to the 6 police officers that were indicted for the death of Freddie Gray. Every acquittal results in the furthering of the countdown of the 6 and a celebration for police officers.</p><p>To my police officer friends: This is not your time to celebrate. A young man lost his life prematurely.&#xA0; If nothing else, this case teaches us that the public has a deep <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2015/4/28/a-history-of-violence-baltimores-broken-relationship-years-in-making.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2015/4/28/a-history-of-violence-baltimores-broken-relationship-years-in-making.html&apos;, &apos;distrust for the police&apos;);">distrust for the police</a>. It is your responsibility to repair that <a href="http://data.baltimoresun.com/news/police-settlements/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://data.baltimoresun.com/news/police-settlements/&apos;, &apos;damaged relationship&apos;);">damaged relationship</a>. I thank you for the sacrifices you make every day, but please understand that celebrating these acquittals is equal to making a mockery of the pain and suffering of people who perceive themselves to be vulnerable or who have been abused by the police. You are entitled to your opinion, but please respect the life of Freddie Gray and the feelings of the community members you have vowed to serve and protect.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>The verdict that comes out tomorrow will be symbolic for the struggle for equality and justice. A lot of work remains to be done to reach those goals. During that process it is vital to remember that holding officers to a high standard is in fact a pro-police movement.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div id="attachment_138674" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-138674 size-medium" src="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310-350x263.jpg?resize=350%2C263" alt="20150425_164310" srcset="//cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 350w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 64w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 768w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 600w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 795w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 1168w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20150425_164310.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1">
