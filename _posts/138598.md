You can view some of his horrifically sexist quotes in this <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/08/20/10-quotes-that-show-exactly-what-donald-trump-thinks-about-women/">list</a>. The worst of the bunch:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You know, it doesn&#x2019;t really matter what [the media] write as long as you&#x2019;ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The Donald has been <a href="http://bluenationreview.com/i-know-exactly-why-donald-trump-is-assaulting-the-clinton-marriage/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://bluenationreview.com/i-know-exactly-why-donald-trump-is-assaulting-the-clinton-marriage/&apos;, &apos;going after&apos;);" target="_blank">going after</a>&#xA0;both Clintons. He may have labeled former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), as &#x201C;Crooked Hillary,&#x201D; but he hates her husband, President Bill Clinton, too.
