In it, the former CIA agent provides what she truly believes is the secret to ending terrorism and war.</p><p>Some of the quotes from the video are moving because they are so simple, and so human. For example, Fox <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kirstenking/everyone-is-sharing-this-former-cia-officers-message-to-amer?utm_term=.ruGDgQlNZ#.ehJRrVo69" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.buzzfeed.com/kirstenking/everyone-is-sharing-this-former-cia-officers-message-to-amer?utm_term=.ruGDgQlNZ#.ehJRrVo69&apos;, &apos;says&apos;);">says</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I think the question we need to be asking as Americans examining our foreign policy, is whether or not we&#x2019;re throwing kerosene on a candle. The only real way to disarm your enemy is to listen to them.&#x201D;</em></p><p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fajplusenglish%2Fvideos%2F744058605735649%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br>
Fox also tells the story of one Al Qaeda operative she spoke to during a debriefing. He talked to her about how the world views the United States. She quoted him as&#xA0;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/744058605735649/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/744058605735649/&apos;, &apos;saying&apos;);">saying</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;All these&#xA0;movies that America makes, like Independence Day and Hunger Games &#xA0;and Star Wars. They&#x2019;re all about a small, scrappy band of rebels who will do anything in their power with the limited resources available to them to expel an outside technologically advanced invader. And what you don&#x2019;t realize, he said, is that to us, to the rest of the world, you are the Empire and we are Luke and Han. You are the aliens and we are Will Smith.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Fascinating idea.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>The best quote came at the end, though. When she talked about how average Syrians or Afghans view the U.S. and how Americans view the Muslim world, she said that so much of what we all think is vastly &#x201C;oversimplified.&#x201D;</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Those are stories manufactured by a really small number of people on both sides who amass a great deal of power and wealth by convincing the rest of us to keep killing each other.&#x201D;</em></p><p class="p1">Please watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/TnEKEfkdrOU" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://youtu.be/TnEKEfkdrOU&apos;, &apos;video&apos;);">video</a>.
