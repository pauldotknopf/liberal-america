This report shows that that effort to date has been a failure. It&#x2019;s not going to inspire donors to invest, and most importantly for donors is that Donald is still holding out the possibility of using their donor money to pay back his loans to the campaign.&#x201D;</em></p><p>A former Bush bundler&#xA0;<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-money-republicans-224607" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-money-republicans-224607&apos;, &apos;was even more apocalyptic&apos;);" target="_blank">was even more apocalyptic</a> when asked about the Trump campaign&#x2019;s lack of adequate financing:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;This is a guy who lent himself $30 [million] or $40 million so chuckleheads and suckers like me would go and raise money for him and then pay himself back. This is a total fraud. He&#x2019;s a fraud. There&#x2019;s a universe of, I don&#x2019;t know, is it 50 percent, is it 30 percent, of the bundler class, who&#x2019;s not going to [contribute]. So that&#x2019;s part of it. And I think we&#x2019;re just not going to stick our necks out for that. This isn&#x2019;t a situation like Ben Carson, where he&#x2019;s blowing through money like nobody&#x2019;s business. I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s blowing through tons of money. They didn&#x2019;t have a huge staff to begin with. They&#x2019;re not fully staffed to run a national campaign.&#x201D;</em></p><p>As is typical for Trump, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-money-republicans-224607" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-money-republicans-224607&apos;, &apos;he says&apos;);" target="_blank">he says</a> there&#x2019;s nothing to worry about:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There could be unlimited &#x2018;cash on hand,&#x2019; as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars. Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>If the federal government was as lean as the Trump campaign, it would be in total fiscal default.</p><p><em>Featured Image Via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/23691565882" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/23691565882&apos;, &apos;Gage Skidmore for Flickr&apos;);" target="_blank">Gage Skidmore for Flickr</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&apos;, &apos;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic&apos;);" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic</a> License</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
