<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>I wrote about one of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s children earlier this month. Michael Reagan was asked about how his dad would have voted in this election. He tweeted:</p><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>He had this to <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/07/ronald-reagans-son-talks-trump-dad-mightve-voted-video/" target="_blank">say</a> about other issues we are facing:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;But really, the GOP these days is no longer a legitimate political party. They&#x2019;re not interested in governing anymore. My father certainly was. The idea of shutting down the government because you&#x2019;re peeved about Planned Parenthood, that&#x2019;s not a thought that ever would have crossed his mind. The idea of a few million dollars going to an organization like that that does a lot of good work for people should be a pretext to shut down the government would just be unthinkable to him.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Ronald Reagan, Jr., is an outspoken atheist and contributor to MSNBC. He was talking about the report that the Federal Election Commission released this week. Donald Trump&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/22/yes-top-5-reasons-donald-trumps-campaign-crashing-burning-tweets-video/" target="_blank">campaign</a> is broke, which is absolutely wonderful.</p><p>He suggests that the media should stop talking about the Trump campaign &#x201C;as if it were normal.&#x201D; He thinks the media <a href="http://winningdemocrats.com/ronald-reagans-son-just-shredded-charlatan-trump-for-running-a-scam-campaign-video/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://winningdemocrats.com/ronald-reagans-son-just-shredded-charlatan-trump-for-running-a-scam-campaign-video/&apos;, &apos;should&apos;);" target="_blank">should</a>&#xA0;talk about:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;The recognition that Donald Trump is a charlatan who is running a scam and is in no way fit for office, and the Republican party has become a dysfunctional, wheels-off-the-bus-sort-of organization. That is the reality that we start with here.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>When asked about whether Bernie Sanders supporters would go to Trump, he <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/ronald-reagan-jr-shreds-charlatan-trump-for-running-a-scam-campaign/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/ronald-reagan-jr-shreds-charlatan-trump-for-running-a-scam-campaign/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;Any intelligent Bernie Sanders supporter is not going to naturally gravitate toward Donald Trump out of a fit of pique over his person not beating Hillary Clinton.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This is what Reagan, Jr., had to say about people who <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/reagan-sons-interview-donald-trump-213149" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/reagan-sons-interview-donald-trump-213149&apos;, &apos;compare&apos;);" target="_blank">compare</a> Donald Trump to his father:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t think of two people who are more diametrically opposed. This egotistical, narcissistic guy with the weird comb over swanning in his private plane. &#x2026; I mean, look in the mirror, fat boy. Look at that hair, you&#x2019;re ridiculous! Where do you get off talking on anybody&#x2019;s appearance? It&#x2019;s just so unchivalrous. My father would recoil at that sort of thing.&#x201D;</em></p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-F0vZttPU-o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
