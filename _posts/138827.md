<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Some people, my paternal grandfather always said, are so stupid they don&#x2019;t even realize how truly ignorant they are.</p><p>Take, as the perfect example of this axiom,&#xA0;NRA News radio host Cam Edwards. Edwards got on his little podunk radio show today (funded in large part by the innocent blood shed by the plethora of weapons of mass death in this country) and decided he&#x2019;d had quite enough of the sit-in staged by Democratic members of the House of Representatives yesterday. In particular, Edwards was especially ticked off by the actions of Congressman John Lewis, one of the pioneers of the civil rights movement.</p><p>Edwards began his incredibly ignorant and <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/23/white-nra-radio-host-lectures-john-lewis-what-sit-ins-were-about-civil-rights-movement/211144" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/23/white-nra-radio-host-lectures-john-lewis-what-sit-ins-were-about-civil-rights-movement/211144&apos;, &apos;offensive comments&apos;);" target="_blank">offensive comments</a> with this:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what to call it, a sit-in, again, generally speaking we saw the sit-ins in the civil rights movement that were advocating for individuals being able to enjoy the same rights that other Americans enjoyed, right?&#xA0;That&#x2019;s what the protests were, that&#x2019;s what &#x2014; we&#x2019;re sitting at this lunch counter and we&#x2019;re not leaving until we get served. Not we&#x2019;re sitting at this lunch counter and we&#x2019;re not leaving until you remove this item from the menu.&#x201D;</em></p><p>But this clueless blob of intestinal gas was far from finished, and <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/23/white-nra-radio-host-lectures-john-lewis-what-sit-ins-were-about-civil-rights-movement/211144" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/23/white-nra-radio-host-lectures-john-lewis-what-sit-ins-were-about-civil-rights-movement/211144&apos;, &apos;he also added&apos;);" target="_blank">he also added</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to sit right here and we&#x2019;re not leaving until you recognize us as human beings, as Americans who have the same rights that that guy has over there and that she has over there. That&#x2019;s what the sit-ins were about in the civil rights movement. This, on the other hand, this isn&#x2019;t Congress demanding more rights for Americans, this isn&#x2019;t Congress demanding rights for themselves, this is Congress demanding power. These are House Democrats demanding the authority and the power to ignore the Fifth Amendment when they see fit, to view the Bill of Rights as an impediment to lawmakers, to treat it as such and to try to degrade. Kind of like what they say with ISIS right?&#x201D;</em></p><p>Ah, so now a sit-in in protest of the lack of action by the Congress on sensible gun control is the equivalent of ISIS and repealing the Fifth Amendment? Really?</p><p>What is most obscene about Cam Edwards&#x2019; mindless bloviating is that he feels in any manner qualified to lecture John Lewis on civil rights. For that alone, Edwards should hang his head in shame and go back to doing the only thing he&#x2019;s good at: Worshiping his guns and shilling for those who manufacture weapons of mass death.</p><p>If you think you can stomach it, here&#x2019;s Cam Edwards earlier today:</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><iframe class="video-embed" src="//mediamatters.org/embed/clips/2016/06/23/47199/nranews-camandcompany-20160623-sitinlesson" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p><em>Video Screengrab Via <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/23/white-nra-radio-host-lectures-john-lewis-what-sit-ins-were-about-civil-rights-movement/211144" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/23/white-nra-radio-host-lectures-john-lewis-what-sit-ins-were-about-civil-rights-movement/211144&apos;, &apos;Media Matters&apos;);" target="_blank">Media Matters</a></em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
