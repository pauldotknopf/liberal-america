Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign.&#xA0;The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Apparently the Trump campaign is not functioning well:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Asked if staff was notified of Corey decision, campaign source tells me it&apos;s &quot;bedlam in the Trump campaign. No one knows what is happening.&quot;</p>
