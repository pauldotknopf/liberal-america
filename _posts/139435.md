<p>The Brexit hangover has officially started. We have already heard from a number of British celebrities who are less than pleased with their homeland&#x2019;s decision to leave the European Union. From &#x201C;Late Late Show&#x201D; host James Corden to renowned author <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/746192965568077824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/746192965568077824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&apos;, &apos;JK Rowling&apos;);" target="_blank">JK Rowling</a>, there are many well-known names <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-celeb-react-brexit-20160624-snap-htmlstory.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-celeb-react-brexit-20160624-snap-htmlstory.html&apos;, &apos;upset&apos;);" target="_blank">upset</a> about Brexit.</p><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Perhaps no one has the ability to express that opinion on an international level quite like&#xA0;John Oliver, the host of HBO&#x2019;s &#x201C;Last Week Tonight.&#x201D; Last Sunday. Oliver detailed what Brexit meant, why it was a bad idea, and urged his fellow countryman to vote to stay in the EU. Not enough people listened, it seems. This week, John Oliver went off.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/iAgKHSNqxa8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Right off the bat, Oliver&#xA0;doesn&#x2019;t pull any punches.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Let us begin straightaway with the United Kingdom, a place whose very name, after this week&#x2019;s events, is beginning to sound a bit sarcastic&#x2026;&#x201D;</em></p><p>Oliver goes on to tear the arguments for Brexit apart brick by break, detailing why the decision was a poor one and laying out the difficulties the country will face in the wake of its decision. He took particular issue with people who are describing the vote as Britain&#x2019;s &#x201C;Independence Day,&#x201D; referencing the popular Hollywood sequel of the same name:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;First of all, Britain was already independent. In fact, it&#x2019;s what many other countries celebrate their independence from&#x2026; And second, the sequel to the movie actually opened this week, and features the wholesale destruction of London, which is beginning to feel pretty f&#x2014;&#x2014; appropriate right now.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Oliver also had some parting warning words for his American viewers, specifically those who are considering voting for Donald Trump:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You might think, that is not going to happen to us in America. Well, let Britain tell you: It can happen, and when it does, there are no f&#x2014;&#x2014; do-overs.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Watch the entire segment above.</p>
