<p>The 2016 Presidential election will technically take place in all 50 states, but some 11 states are considered to be swing or battleground states, and that&#x2019;s where the election will be most hotly contested and where it will ultimately be won.</p><p>The latest polling data from those key 11 states has some very good news for Hillary Clinton: She leads in seven of them by margins ranging from four to 17 points over Donald Trump. Such is the stuff landslides are made of.</p><p>Of the seven states surveyed by <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Polling" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://ballotpedia.org/Polling&apos;, &apos;Ballotpedia&apos;);" target="_blank">Ballotpedia</a>, Clinton&#x2019;s lead was slimmest in Iowa, where registered voters preferred her by just four points. Clinton&#x2019;s biggest&#xA0;lead came in Michigan, where Trump has said he can definitely compete in November. Clinton leads the Trump in Michigan&#xA0;by 17 points, 50 percent to 33 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile the former Secretary of State also <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Polling" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://ballotpedia.org/Polling&apos;, &apos;has leads&apos;);" target="_blank">has leads</a> in the states of Florida&#xA0;(14 points), Pennsylvania (14 points), and North Carolina (10 points) Clinton leads by nine points in Ohio and seven points in Virginia.</p><p>When respondents were offered another option&#x2013;Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson&#x2013;Clinton&#x2019;s <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Polling" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://ballotpedia.org/Polling&apos;, &apos;lead in the states&apos;);" target="_blank">lead in the states</a> shifted slightly.&#xA0;In a three-way race, Clinton&#x2019;s lead among those surveyed shrank to three points in Iowa and six points in North Carolina. But with Johnson&#x2019;s as an option, Clinton&#x2019;s lead actually grew to 15 points Pennsylvania and eight points in Virginia.</p><p>The presumptive Democratic nominee also got good news today from statistical guru Nate Silver, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fivethirtyeights-nate-silver-predicts-hillary-clinton-wins-election/story?id=40213871" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fivethirtyeights-nate-silver-predicts-hillary-clinton-wins-election/story?id=40213871&apos;, &apos;who said that&apos;);" target="_blank">who said that</a> Clinton has a 79 percent chance of being the next President of the United States. Trump has a 20 percent chance of reaching the White House:</p><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Silver compared the election a football game, remarking:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re at halftime of the election right now. She&#x2019;s taking a 7-point, maybe a 10-point lead into halftime. There&#x2019;s a lot of football left to be played. She&#x2019;s ahead in almost every poll, every swing state, every national poll.&#x201D;</em></p><p>It should be noted that Silver&#xA0;called 49 states correctly in the 2008 presidential election and got all 50 right in 2012.</p>
