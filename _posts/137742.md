<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Two active-duty members of the United States Marine Corps are under formal investigation for a posting they made on Facebook which seems to suggest a violent threat against homosexuals and gay bars.</p><p>The investigation <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/coming-soon-to-a-gay-bar-near-you-marines-post-violent-facebook-threat-against-gays/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/coming-soon-to-a-gay-bar-near-you-marines-post-violent-facebook-threat-against-gays/&apos;, &apos;began when&#xA0;a photo&apos;);" target="_blank">began when&#xA0;a photo</a> was posted on a closed Facebook group for male marines showing a marine corporal in uniform pointing a rifle at the camera with the caption:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Coming to a gay bar near you!&#x201D;</em></p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-137744 aligncenter" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/216.jpg?resize=259%2C345" alt="2" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/216.jpg?resize=259%2C345 259w, http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/216.jpg?resize=259%2C345 64w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The marines who posted the photo <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/coming-soon-to-a-gay-bar-near-you-marines-post-violent-facebook-threat-against-gays/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/coming-soon-to-a-gay-bar-near-you-marines-post-violent-facebook-threat-against-gays/&apos;, &apos;are members of&apos;);" target="_blank">are members of</a> the California-based I Marine Expeditionary Force and carry the rank of corporal.</p><p>First Lt.

We can hope the Marine Corps will get to the bottom of the matter and that those responsible will be punished appropriately.</p><p><em>Featured Image Via Facebook&#xA0;</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
