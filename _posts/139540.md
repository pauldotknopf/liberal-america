<p>Oh, boy howdy.

She checked the boxes because she believed that she had Native American ancestry. Both of the schools have been very clear in saying that her heritage played no part in her hiring.</p><p>That didn&#x2019;t stop the Trumpster from attacking her for it, though. He has repeatedly tried to claim that the Senator cheated her way into her faculty positions.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Senator Warren has shrugged off the racist attacks, but some Native Americans have had a harder time.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Navajo leaders reject meeting with Trump in campaign of &#x2018;Pocahontas&#x2019; taunts. <a href="https://t.co/SK6Cl0mXB7" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/SK6Cl0mXB7&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/SK6Cl0mXB7&apos;);">https://t.co/SK6Cl0mXB7</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/LasVegasSun" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/LasVegasSun&apos;, &apos;@LasVegasSun&apos;);">@LasVegasSun</a></p>

She told MSNBC that she herself has some Native American background. She added that Trump&#x2019;s continuous labeling of Senator Warren as Pocahontas might not be so terrible.
