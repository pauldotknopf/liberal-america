Although Abell&#x2019;s store doesn&#x2019;t sell body armor, staff felt it was an odd request and one they don&#x2019;t usually receive from a customer.</p><p>After staff told Mateen they couldn&#x2019;t sell them what he was looking for, he then asked for bulk ammunition &#x2013; another suspicious request.&#xA0;Once again, staff denied his request and refused to sell him anything else from their store. Lotus staff then proceeded to report the alarming incident to the FBI, according to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3645092/Orlando-shooter-Omar-Mateen-turned-away-gun-store-weeks-attack-asking-buy-heavy-duty-armor-bulk-ammo-muttering-phone-Arabic-rejected.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3645092/Orlando-shooter-Omar-Mateen-turned-away-gun-store-weeks-attack-asking-buy-heavy-duty-armor-bulk-ammo-muttering-phone-Arabic-rejected.html&apos;, &apos;reports&apos;);" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3645092/Orlando-shooter-Omar-Mateen-turned-away-gun-store-weeks-attack-asking-buy-heavy-duty-armor-bulk-ammo-muttering-phone-Arabic-rejected.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3645092/Orlando-shooter-Omar-Mateen-turned-away-gun-store-weeks-attack-asking-buy-heavy-duty-armor-bulk-ammo-muttering-phone-Arabic-rejected.html&apos;, &apos;Daily Mail&apos;);" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a> noted that Mateen had already been investigated by the FBI years earlier, but was still able to purchase ammunition, an AR-15 and a semi-automatic pistol from another local gun shop.</p><p>Abell told the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932&apos;, &apos;Wall Street Journal&apos;);" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> that Mateen was walking around the store on his cell phone speaking to someone in Arabic and also texting.</p><p>Abell was also told the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932&apos;, &apos;Journal&apos;);" target="_blank">Journal</a>&#xA0;that Mateen was odd, saying:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The questions he was asking were not the normal questions a normal person would be asking&#x2026; He just seemed very odd.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Abell&#x2019;s staff were on high alert after authorities told them to watch for suspicious activity in the area.</p><p>After Mateen was identified as the assailant of the attack at Pulse nightclub, Abell&#x2019;s staff immediately reported their experience to the FBI.</p><p>Abell also told the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932&apos;, &apos;WSJ&apos;);" target="_blank">WSJ</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;If something is suspicious, it&#x2019;s our discretion.
