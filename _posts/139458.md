<em> you knit me together in my mother&#x2019;s womb.</em><br>
<em> 14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</em><br>
<em> Wonderful are your works;</em><br>
<em> that I know very well.</em></p><p>You are wonderful. Has anyone told you that today? You have purpose and there is meaning to your life. There is something for which you were created that no other person can do as beautifully as you. I believe that with all my heart.</p><p>My message box is filled daily with letters from so many of you who are suffering. Your hearts are broken. You are hurt and searching for answers and direction. Yet, in your messages I read compassion, intelligence, empathy, and devotion, which are exactly the things this broken world needs.</p><p>What if I told you that YOU are the answer? What if each and everyone of us had the confidence to live into the amazing creature we already are; what would we be able to accomplish?</p><p class="passage-display" style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204:10-11&amp;version=ESV" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204:10-11&amp;version=ESV&apos;, &apos;1 Peter 4:10-11&apos;);" target="_blank"><em><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 Peter 4:10-11</span></em></a></p><p class="passage-display" style="padding-left: 30px"><em><span id="en-ESV-30440" class="text 1Pet-4-10"><sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God&#x2019;s varied grace:</span> <span id="en-ESV-30441" class="text 1Pet-4-11"><sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies&#x2014;in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span></em></p><p class="passage-display">What if each of us woke up every morning and instead of being weighed down by our sorrows, we were held up by the understanding that we are made exactly as we should be. We have purpose and have been given the strengths and gifts to pursue that purpose. No opinion or statement from any person or group can take away the fact that you are perfectly made in the image of God, and you are loved just as you are.</p><p class="passage-display">Don&#x2019;t be afraid to speak truth, wisdom, acceptance, and love. Someone you meet today is needing to hear it, and you are the perfect one to tell them.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A25-27&amp;version=CEB" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A25-27&amp;version=CEB&apos;, &apos;1 Corinthians 12:25-27&apos;);" target="_blank"><em>1 Corinthians 12:25-27</em></a></p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>25 so that there won&#x2019;t be division in the body and so the parts might have mutual concern for each other. 26 If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if one part gets the glory, all the parts celebrate with it. 27 You are the body of Christ and parts of each other.</em></p><p>Go forth this day, empowered by the knowledge that you are wonderfully made. You are the answer to the world&#x2019;s problems. And you have been given gifts and strength to lead and love the people around you.</p><p>May your path be illuminated before you. May you have the wisdom to see it, the courage to take it, and the strength to follow it through.</p>
