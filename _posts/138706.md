</div><p>We&#x2019;ve learned not to expect a whole lot out of Oklahoma, one of the reddest states in the Union. But even by those standards, one Republican state lawmaker may have <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/06/21/3790697/oklahoma-lawmaker-islam-final-solution/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/06/21/3790697/oklahoma-lawmaker-islam-final-solution/&apos;, &apos;really outdone himself&apos;);">really outdone himself</a>. He apparently thinks that Islam&#xA0;is so inherently dangerous that the only way forward is a &#x201C;final solution.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/District.aspx?District=48" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.okhouse.gov/District.aspx?District=48&apos;, &apos;Pat Ownbey&apos;);">Pat Ownbey</a> represents the 48th district, comprising Ardmore and the surrounding area, in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. On Father&#x2019;s Day, he found a blog post from Paul Hollrah, a retired government relations executive and two-time Republican presidential elector, <a href="http://www.orderofephors.com/?p=2350" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.orderofephors.com/?p=2350&apos;, &apos;arguing&apos;);">arguing</a> that Islam does not deserve First Amendment protection. Ownbey liked it so much that he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pat.ownbey/posts/10206644960185855" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/pat.ownbey/posts/10206644960185855&apos;, &apos;copy-pasted the whole thing&apos;);">copy-pasted the whole thing</a> to his Facebook wall.</p><p>Hollrah claims&#xA0;Islam isn&#x2019;t a religion at all, but a self-contained cultural system &#x201C;with a religious component&#x201D;&#x2013;one that is &#x201C;totally foreign to and incompatible with 21st century values and cultures.&#x201D; To see Islam as anything else is a &#x201C;cruel fiction&#x201D; that turns the First Amendment into &#x201C;a suicide pact.&#x201D;&#xA0;We&#x2019;ve heard this before. It&#x2019;s the same &#x201C;logic&#x201D; that a number of right-wing tailenders have used to claim that&#xA0;a Muslim <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/02/24/larry-klayman-thinks-obama-cant-honestly-take-oath-of-office-because-hes-a-muslim/">should not be eligible</a> to serve as a lawmaker or any other elected official because a Muslim cannot honestly take the oath of office.</p><p>But Hollrah goes further than that. He claims that because radical Islamists engage in &#x201C;atrocities that are unique to the Muslim world&#x201D; and more moderate Muslims &#x201C;appear unwilling&#x201D; to rein them in, Islam doesn&#x2019;t deserve the same level of protection as other religions. For that reason, he gives full-throated support to Donald Trump&#x2019;s proposed ban on Muslim immigration. He argues that Trump has every right to do this under the McCarran-Walter Act, which bars any alien who supports or teaches overthrowing the government from entering this country.</p><p>As if that wasn&#x2019;t outrageous enough, Hollrah calls for the United States and the rest of the Western world to&#xA0;&#x201C;quarantine&#x201D; all Muslims and bar them from &#x201C;residing anywhere within the civilized nations of the Earth.&#x201D;&#xA0;I hope I&#x2019;m misreading what Hollrah is saying here. I really do. What he is proposing is a carbon copy of one of the&#xA0;blackest slurs&#xA0;on our country&#x2019;s history&#x2013;the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II solely on the basis that they might be more loyal to Japan than the United States.</p><p>And I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s an accident that Hollrah calls this a &#x201C;final solution.&#x201D; After all, it&#x2019;s the exact term Adolf Hitler used for the Holocaust. It doesn&#x2019;t seem that Hollrah is calling for Muslims to be murdered while under &#x201C;quarantine.&#x201D; However, it doesn&#x2019;t sound like he would shed any tears if they did die, since he doesn&#x2019;t want them in any &#x201C;civilized nations.&#x201D;</p><p>According to Ownbey&#x2019;s&#xA0;official biography, he has a degree from the University of Oklahoma, which is a fairly decent school; it touts more National Merit Scholars than any public university in this country.&#xA0;Unless Ownbey slept through his history classes in high school and at OU, he is almost certainly aware of the Japanese internment travesty, as well as what the term &#x201C;final solution&#x201D; meant in history. Thus, his decision to repost this disgusting article in its entirety is grossly ignorant at best and un-American at worst.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Like most of Oklahoma, Ownbey&#x2019;s district has turned&#xA0;redder than OU&#x2019;s jerseys. According to Daily Kos&#x2019; excellent <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZRfFiCDBEYB7M18fDGLH8IrmyMQGdQKqpOu9lLvmdo/edit#gid=314107695" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZRfFiCDBEYB7M18fDGLH8IrmyMQGdQKqpOu9lLvmdo/edit#gid=314107695&apos;, &apos;database&apos;);">database</a> of presidential results in state legislative districts, Mitt Romney carried the 48th by a punishing 68-32 margin. In other words&#x2013;this district would vote for a comatose Republican. But you really have to wonder&#x2013;is this acceptable behavior for a lawmaker, even in a district this congested red?</p><p>Maybe we should ask Ownbey ourselves&#x2013;politely, of course. He hasn&#x2019;t said anything on the matter since this post, but this lawmaker&#xA0;can&#x2019;t remain silent forever.
