Yes, a psychopath was allowed to buy a semi-automatic weapon despite multiple red flags from the FBI and a <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/18/gun-shop-owner-refused-sell-firearms-omar-mateen-reported-authorities-orlando-attack/">gun store owner</a>&#xA0;with enough experience to pick up a weird vibe from Omar Mateen shortly before he killed fifty people. But seriously, don&#x2019;t worry, because our elected officials have deployed their secret weapon.</p><p>They&#x2019;ve offered their thoughts and prayers.</p><p>If you would like to know how it feels to possess such powers, you&#xA0;too can simulate the experience with this game:</p><p><a href="http://www.thoughtsandprayersthegame.com/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.thoughtsandprayersthegame.com/&apos;, &apos;Thoughts &amp; Prayers: The Game&apos;);">Thoughts &amp; Prayers: The Game</a></p><div id="attachment_138033" style="width: 971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-138033 size-full" src="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533" alt="2016-06-19 10_30_13-Greenshot" srcset="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533 961w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533 64w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533 350w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533 768w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533 600w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-19-10_30_13-Greenshot.png?resize=961%2C533 795w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>This isn&#x2019;t about mocking prayer. I&#x2019;m a Christian, and I don&#x2019;t deny the power of prayer and would never mock a person&#x2019;s belief in that power. But I also know that offering prayer in order to avoid action is not the point of prayer. It brings to mind the <a href="http://truthbook.com/stories/funny-god/the-drowning-man" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://truthbook.com/stories/funny-god/the-drowning-man&apos;, &apos;old joke&apos;);">old joke</a> about the man in the flood:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;A fellow was stuck on his rooftop in a flood.

</div><p>Every time a congressman took to Twitter or Facebook, we got more thoughts and prayers, and still no action. Too often, in any kind of crisis, our leaders are too afraid to take a stand on anything; too afraid to address real issues. Instead, when a gunman walks into a classroom of 1st graders and kills them all, we get more thoughts and prayers.</p><p>If you believe in any kind of god, I suggest no longer letting our leaders use your god as a scapegoat.</p><p>Watch Will McAvoy on HBO&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>The Newsroom</em> (played by Jeff Daniels) call out a Halliburton spokesman trying to escape responsibility for the BP oil spill by offering his thoughts and prayers:</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9DZd1GV_0WA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured image screenshot of Thoughts &amp; Prayers: The Game by <a href="http://www.thoughtsandprayersthegame.com/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.thoughtsandprayersthegame.com/&apos;, &apos;GOP Arcade&apos;);">GOP Arcade</a></em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
