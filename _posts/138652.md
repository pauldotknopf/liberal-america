He <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/284462-sanders-doesnt-appear-ill-be-nominee#.V2rM-23SeI4.twitter" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/284462-sanders-doesnt-appear-ill-be-nominee#.V2rM-23SeI4.twitter&apos;, &apos;replied&apos;);" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to say. It doesn&#x2019;t appear that I&#x2019;m going to be the nominee so I&#x2019;m not going to be determining the scope of the convention.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This is the first time Sanders has said publicly that he will not be the nominee of the Democratic Party for President.</p><p>Sanders did urge Democrats to &#x201C;create the most progressive platform as we possibly can reflecting the needs of working families and students and the environment, health care, and so forth.&#x201D;</p><p>When asked if he thought his supporters would switch their allegiance to Donald Trump, who is perceived as an outsider like the Senator from Vermont, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/284462-sanders-doesnt-appear-ill-be-nominee#.V2rM-23SeI4.twitter" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/284462-sanders-doesnt-appear-ill-be-nominee#.V2rM-23SeI4.twitter&apos;, &apos;Sanders said&apos;);" target="_blank">Sanders said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The vast majority of the people who voted for me understand that Donald Trump in a dozen different ways is literally unfit to be president of the United States. And it&#x2019;s not only his views on the issues&#x2026; but mostly his making bigotry the cornerstone of this campaign.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Senator Sanders should be commended for all of the positive issues and much-needed debate he has been able to generate with his amazing campaign. This time a year ago, no one thought it possible for him to do as well as he has. His success is a tribute to the amazing power of people who unite for a common goal. And the next goal is to defeat Donald Trump in November.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>To see the full interview, click <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?411569-1/bernie-sanders-discusses-presidential-campaign" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.c-span.org/video/?411569-1/bernie-sanders-discusses-presidential-campaign&apos;, &apos;HERE&apos;);" target="_blank">HERE</a></p><p><em>Featured Image Via C-SPAN Screengrab</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
