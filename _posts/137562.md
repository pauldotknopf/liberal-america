Throughout the campaign, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to the issues that matter to working people, and our members have taken notice. The activism of working people has already been a major force in this election and is now poised to elect Hillary Clinton and move America forward.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The AFL-CIO has never gotten involved in Democratic primaries, so it was just a matter of time before they made an endorsement once Clinton became the presumptive nominee. There was absolutely no way organized labor would ever support Donald Trump, even though he and his surrogates have repeatedly said they felt labor would be on their side since the GOP nominee would be good for the economy and for workers.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>It should be noted, however, that organized labor does not have nearly the political clout it once did.

But unions still run an impressive&#xA0;ground game. Clinton will benefit from the AFL-CIO&#x2019;s advertising buys and get-out-the-vote efforts. In 2012, AFL-CIO&#x2019;s super PAC, Workers Voice, spent $22 million in support of candidate across the country.</p><p><em>Featured Image Via YouTube Screengrab</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
