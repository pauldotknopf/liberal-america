<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>Donald Trump just happened to be in the United Kingdom today&#x2013;Scotland, to be exact&#x2013;at an incredibly historic and uncertain moment in British history: the Brits had just voted to leave the European Union, so it seemed like a reasonable assertion that the presumptive GOP nominee would have some comments to make on the now-concluded Brexit vote.</p><p>Trump, it has been obvious this week, is desperate to appear serious and relevant as the Republican convention approaches next month. He fired his longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and gave a speech that was supposed to be about his plans for the American economy but wound up being nothing more than a giant pack of lies about Hillary Clinton.</p><p>So, Mr. Trump, any thoughts on the Brexit vote? How will it affect the United States? What does it mean for the American economy, which is so closely tied to the economy of the European nations? His <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-gives-bizarre-rambling-scotland-speech-all-about-his-golf-courses-and-suites/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-gives-bizarre-rambling-scotland-speech-all-about-his-golf-courses-and-suites/&apos;, &apos;response&apos;);" target="_blank">response</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve taken the lighthouse, which is a very, very important building in Florida &#x2014; I mean in Scotland &#x2014; and we&#x2019;ve taken that building and made it something really special. It has incredible suites&#x2026;golfers will stop and they&#x2019;ll have something to eat.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Lighthouse? Florida? WTF?! We later learned that Trump was <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-gives-bizarre-rambling-scotland-speech-all-about-his-golf-courses-and-suites/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-gives-bizarre-rambling-scotland-speech-all-about-his-golf-courses-and-suites/&apos;, &apos;referring to&apos;);" target="_blank">referring to</a> the lighthouse at the Turnberry golf course he was visiting, but what exactly does that have to do with Brexit and the future of the free world? Nothing, but Trump is too damn stupid to respond to a question on a serious issue, so he went into default bullshit mode and started in on lighthouses and eating. And notice he thinks he&#x2019;s in Florida!</p><p>The cable news networks quickly cut away from Trump&#x2019;s vapid commentary, and David Gregory, who was appearing on CNN, correctly dubbed the verbal inanity from Trump &#x201C;political malpractice.&#x201D;</p><p>Donald Trump is a moron. He&#x2019;s also not a very good businessman. And yet millions of people are clamoring for this lightweight to be President of the United States? He&#x2019;s not even ready to be a caddy on the PGA tour!</p><p>Care to see how stupid Trump is?
