<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Police arrested 19-year-old Michael Sandford at a Donald Trump (R-N.Y.) rally last week in Las Vegas, after he attempted to pull a police officer&#x2019;s gun from its holster.</p><p>The police officer was part of the local law enforcement on duty supplementing Trump&#x2019;s U.S. Secret Service protection, as is often the case during rallies.</p><p>According to a new criminal <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/19/politics/trump-rally-gun-police-officer/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/19/politics/trump-rally-gun-police-officer/index.html&apos;, &apos;complaint&apos;);">complaint</a>&#xA0;obtained by CNN Politics, Sanford told authorities he intended to use the gun &#x201C;to kill Trump.&#x201D;</p><p>Originally being from England, Sanford remained&#xA0;illegally in the U.S. after his visa had expired. Apparently, he&#x2019;d been spending the last month living in his car.</p><p>Sandford told police that he drove to Las Vegas from California with the purpose &#x201C;to kill Trump.&#x201D; He even went to a gun range in Las Vegas on June 17, the day before the rally, to practice shooting a gun.</p><p>Police said that Sandford tried to access a gun by starting a conversation with a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer, pretending he was there to get an autograph. While they were talking, Sandford tried to pull the officer&#x2019;s weapon from its holster. Luckily he didn&#x2019;t succeed, and other police officers helped to detain Sandford.</p><p>Sandford made an appearance before a federal judge yesterday, and was charged with committing a violent act in a restricted area. According to the complaint, Sandford <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/19/politics/trump-rally-gun-police-officer/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/19/politics/trump-rally-gun-police-officer/index.html&apos;, &apos;stated&apos;);">stated</a> that</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;If he were on the street tomorrow, he would try this again.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The complaint also showed long-term planning leading up to&#xA0;the act;</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Sandford claimed he had been planning to kill Trump for about a year but decided to act on this occasion because he finally felt confident about trying it.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Had he not felt&#xA0;confident enough to go through with the attempt at the Las Vegas event, he planned to try at Trump&#x2019;s next rally in Phoenix, Arizona, instead.<br>
Sandford is charged with violating two federal laws following the incident.</p><p>One of the violations is assault, and if Sandford is convicted, he could face up to a decade in prison. The&#xA0;judge yesterday ordered him to stay in custody until his next court appearance, which is a preliminary hearing scheduled for July 5.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>The Secret Service said other charges are still pending and the incident remains under investigation.</p><p>According to public <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-las-vegas-us-election-2016-a7092321.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-las-vegas-us-election-2016-a7092321.html&apos;, &apos;defender&apos;);">defender</a> Heather Fraley, Sandford appeared to be competent and he has not been diagnosed with a mental illness. However, he has autism and a history of attempted suicide. He did not expect to survive the attempt.</p><p>One can only be very, very grateful that this unbalanced Brit did not have access to any weapons of his own, and that no-one in the crowded Las Vegas venue had to lose their life. There seems to have been no further disruption of the event.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HGt89aglU40?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured Image: Screenshot Of Newsy V<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGt89aglU40" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGt89aglU40&apos;, &apos;ideo&apos;);">ideo</a>&#xA0;Via YouTube.</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
