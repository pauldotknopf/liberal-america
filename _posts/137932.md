The county center in Hillsborough, Florida, put up a rainbow flag outside of the building. One employee anonymously complained that the flag was &#x201C;unbearable,&#x201D; and created a &#x201C;hostile work environment.&#x201D;</p><p>Poor thing. The flag too much for you? We are mourning the loss of life, but the flag is just too much for you to bear. Seriously?</p><p>The County Commissioner, Stacy White <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/florida-official-complains-raising-lgbt-flag-after-orlando-creates-hostile-work-environment/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/florida-official-complains-raising-lgbt-flag-after-orlando-creates-hostile-work-environment/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;My office recently received an anonymous phone call from a county employee stating that, because of her strong Christian beliefs, it will be nearly unbearable for her pass the &#x2018;pride&#x2019; flag each morning as she enters the workplace. She clearly indicated that the display of that flag, for her, has created a hostile work environment.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Did Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis move to Florida? What about Alabama&#x2019;s Chief Justice Roy Moore, where&#x2019;s he?</p><p>White <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/17/lgbt-flag-outside-florida-county-center-is-unbearable-says-christian-employee/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/17/lgbt-flag-outside-florida-county-center-is-unbearable-says-christian-employee/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It is still &#x2014; in my view &#x2014; unconscionable that the county administrator didn&#x2019;t express to the board that this divisive symbol might create an uncomfortable workplace environment for many of his employees.&#x201D;</em></p><p>It&#x2019;s not divisive. The only people that would feel uncomfortable about this flag are the ones that think the LGBT community doesn&#x2019;t deserve equal rights. The people that would be uncomfortable with this are the RWNJs saying that the victims <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/13/rwnj-pastor-spews-hate-filled-rhetoric-response-orlando-lgbt-shooting/" target="_blank">deserved</a> it.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>At least one employee has some sense.
