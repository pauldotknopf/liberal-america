<!--Ads1--></p><p>Donald Trump (R-N.Y.)&#xA0;is definitely not a friend of reporters. He has a long-going <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/18/watch-trump-turns-babbling-fool-megyn-kelly-asks-bimbo-remarks/" target="_blank">feud</a> with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. He was mad because&#xA0;she called him out for calling women &#x201C;bimbos.&#x201D; Because, how dare you point out the sexist things that he did.</p><p>She was so mean to expose his misogyny and ask how many times he called women &#x201C;bimbos.&#x201D;</p><p>As if that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, he <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/11/26/donald-trump-how-dare-you-call-me-out-for-mocking-a-disabled-person-with-video/" target="_blank">mocked</a> a disabled reporter as well.&#xA0;Serge Kovaleski said that Donald Trump lied (shocker) about seeing people celebrating 9/11 when the attack&#xA0;happened. It&#x2019;s a claim he&#x2019;s made before; he said there were thousands of Muslims in New York City cheering the attack.</p><p>Kovaleski has&#xA0;arthrogryposis, a condition which limits his ability to move his arms because of atrophy. Trump was blatantly mocking this man&#x2019;s disability and his mannerisms; I guess The Donald&#xA0;is stuck in elementary school.</p><p>Trump actually asked the paper that Kovaleski works for to apologize to him. That is completely disgusting.</p><p>Donald Trump often makes members of the press stand in a cordoned off area at this rallies. They just have to huddle together like cattle and put up with Trump ridiculing them the whole time.</p><p>Here are some of the&#xA0;outlets that Trump has <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-media-blacklist/index.html?iid=hp-stack-dom" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-media-blacklist/index.html?iid=hp-stack-dom&apos;, &apos;banned&apos;);" target="_blank">banned</a> from his rallies.
