<p>No doubt you&#x2019;ve seen Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson all over the cable news networks. She is, in my opinion, second only to Donald Trump himself when it comes to being utterly clueless, deceitful, and full of bullcrap.</p><p>On Saturday, Pierson once again proved her complete lack of comprehension regarding a major issue of the week: the Brexit vote, which was approved by British voters and means the United Kingdom will now be leaving the European Union.</p><p>Pierson, appearing on the CNN show &#x201C;Smerconish,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BVtizXe2w" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BVtizXe2w&apos;, &apos;told the host&apos;);" target="_blank">told the host</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;At the end of the day, this is about the people. And you see people all over the world who are tired of being told what to do, how to do it, how much money you can make, what you can and can&#x2019;t eat. Enough is enough, and Brexit is just the beginning.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Oh, so it has nothing all to do with racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and other darker and more sinister motives? That&#x2019;s odd, because more than a few voters who were interviewed after the referendum said it was indeed about their fear of &#x201C;others.&#x201D; There are even <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3659842/No-Polish-vermin-Police-investigating-laminated-cards-reading-leave-EU-home-scum-posted-doors.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3659842/No-Polish-vermin-Police-investigating-laminated-cards-reading-leave-EU-home-scum-posted-doors.html&apos;, &apos;reports from England&apos;);" target="_blank">reports from England</a> of cards being placed in the houses of Polish immigrants that read:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;No more Polish vermin!&#x201D;</em></p><p>Vermin. Human beings being labeled as rats. That&#x2019;s reminiscent of what the Nazis said about Jews, about homosexuals, about the mentally ill. And yet despite declarations after the Holocaust of &#x201C;never again,&#x201D; we see the ugly face of hatred spreading across the European continent once again.</p><p>Pierson <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/katrina-pierson-defends-brexit-vote-people-dont-want-to-be-told-what-to-eat/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/katrina-pierson-defends-brexit-vote-people-dont-want-to-be-told-what-to-eat/&apos;, &apos;also told&apos;);" target="_blank">also told</a> Michael Smerconish:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The people of the UK decided, &#x2018;Look, we know it&#x2019;s going to be a tough road. We&#x2019;re going to have to do all of these things, renegotiate our trade contracts. But we&#x2019;ve cut out the middle man.&#x2019; It might be bumpy up front, but they&#x2019;ve done the right thing for them.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The British stock market tanked on Friday, the pound is now at its lowest level in 30 years, and the UK is likely facing a recession. Hey, let&#x2019;s have a parade!</p><p>If the Brexit is such a great thing and so many Brits are delighted with what they&#x2019;ve done, why have <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/26/uk-voters-3-million-of-them-want-another-bite-at-the-brexit-apple.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/26/uk-voters-3-million-of-them-want-another-bite-at-the-brexit-apple.html&apos;, &apos;3 million of them&apos;);" target="_blank">3 million of them</a> signed an online petition in the past 48 hours calling for a re-vote? We could ask Ms. Pierson, but she&#x2019;s far too obsessed with no one telling her what to eat.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the moronic Katrina Pierson on CNN:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/28BVtizXe2w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
