Only 28 percent say he should remain as chairman.</p><p>A closer look at the poll <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/politics/donald-trump-business-poll/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/politics/donald-trump-business-poll/index.html&apos;, &apos;also shows that&apos;);" target="_blank">also shows that</a> the consensus for Trump to cut his business ties reaches across political boundaries, with&#xA0;56% of Republicans, 71% of independents, and 77% of Democrats saying Trump should not run his business directly while engaged in a campaign for the highest office in the land. Even&#xA0;among those who say they would vote for Trump against Hillary Clinton, 55% say he should to step aside while his career in politics continues.</p><p>The numbers for Trump also stand in stark contrast to the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/politics/donald-trump-business-poll/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/politics/donald-trump-business-poll/index.html&apos;, &apos;same question&apos;);" target="_blank">same question</a> regarding former President Bill Clinton, who is also on the board of the Clinton Foundation.

So far, Trump has the lead in this dubious category, with 7 in 10 women saying they have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. In recent weeks, Clinton has been defining Trump as unfit to be Commander-in-Chief and a threat to the American economy.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>Yesterday, Trump attempted to fight back against Clinton, but his speech, billed as an economic address, was little more than one-liners and accusations which were easily proven untrue by fact-checkers.</p>
