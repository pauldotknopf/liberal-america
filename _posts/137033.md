Florida&#x2019;s soon to be ex-Senator, Marco Rubio joined his Republican colleagues in the time-honored tear-licking festival giving his &#x201C;thoughts and prayers&#x201D; to the families of victims that he and his party couldn&#x2019;t have cared less about when they were alive.</p><p>Later on Sunday, Sen. Rubio made sure&#xA0;<a href="https://youtu.be/_7Z24LR-SPQ" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://youtu.be/_7Z24LR-SPQ&apos;, &apos;he looked&apos;);">he looked</a> appropriately disheveled and concerned while he paraded himself in front of numerous news cameras.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_7Z24LR-SPQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Some may criticize the cynical tone of this article.</p><p>However, there is a good reason why many people within and outside of the LGBT community hold Rubio&#x2019;s sympathy in low regard.</p><p>Mainly due to the fact that while serving as a U.S. Senator, Rubio repeatedly played to his homophobic base by supporting the disenfranchisement of the very victims he claimed to mourn.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZkhyDXHwp5M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Rubio decided to abandon his U.S. Senate seat in order to run for the GOP presidential nomination. After getting destroyed by Chris Christie and then by Donald Trump, Rubio failed to carry his home state of Florida in the GOP primaries.</p><p>His embarrassing defeat signaled the end of his painfully awkward campaign.</p><p>And like many of his &#x201C;principled&#x201D; Republican colleagues, who swore to uphold the honor and dignity of their party&#x2019;s&#xA0;values, and prevent Trump from becoming &#xA0;president, turned around and endorsed the billionaire.</p><p>On Monday&#x2019;s edition of the Hugh Hewitt radio show, Rubio revealed that he may try to get his soon to be old job back, using the Orlando mass shooting as a&#xA0;chance to &#x201C;pray,&#x201D; and reflect on his future course of action.
