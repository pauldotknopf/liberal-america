<p>A&#xA0;web-based app that will teach students in primary school about the implications of discrimination <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/new-app-to-tackle-racism-in-schools-20160624-gprbr5.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/new-app-to-tackle-racism-in-schools-20160624-gprbr5.html&apos;, &apos;and racism&apos;);">and racism</a>, sponsored by the All Together Now <a href="http://alltogethernow.org.au/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://alltogethernow.org.au/&apos;, &apos;initiative&apos;);">initiative</a>, will use real-life scenarios to showcase active discrimination.&#xA0;The thought process of this app is to foster a sense of self-awareness in children to help stifle stereotyping.</p><p>An adult version of the app was already a hit.</p><p>The Every Day Racism <a href="https://everydayracismproject.wordpress.com/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://everydayracismproject.wordpress.com/&apos;, &apos;project&apos;);">project</a> allowed people to live vicariously through a Muslim person, an Aboriginal man, or an Indian student. Every couple of days, the person who downloaded the app will receive a text or video message that will help challenge preconceived notions that they might have.</p><h2>The Effects Of Racism In School-Aged Children</h2><p>There are real life consequences for those who are subject to racism. A <a href="http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/En/News/NewsAndFeatures/Pages/children-racism-long-term-impacts.aspx" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/En/News/NewsAndFeatures/Pages/children-racism-long-term-impacts.aspx&apos;, &apos;study&apos;);">study</a> by the American Journal of Public health has noted that children who are exposed to moderate racial discrimination can actually experience illnesses.</p><p>Racism isn&#x2019;t just a sole act of demeaning someone due to their ethnic background, but it also contributes to school and housing segregation, which limits a child&#x2019;s social circle.</p><p>One of the earliest study of childhood racism comes from an experiment in 1939. The Clark Doll <a href="https://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/the-clark-doll-experiment/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/the-clark-doll-experiment/&apos;, &apos;experiment&apos;);">experiment</a> was an experiment that showed how colorism occurs even in very young children.</p><p>An example is how it was used&#xA0;in the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment&apos;, &apos;Brown v. Board of Education&apos;);">Brown v. Board of Education</a>&#xA0;case to show that separate does not mean equal.</p><h2>Launching In Australia</h2><p>The app will first have a <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/new-app-to-tackle-racism-in-schools-20160624-gprbr5.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/new-app-to-tackle-racism-in-schools-20160624-gprbr5.html&apos;, &apos;test group&apos;);">test group</a> of as many as 400 children in New South Wales and Victoria, where one out of three schoolchildren are either immigrants to Australia or at least have an immigrant parent. As diverse as Australia is, sadly one in five students experience some sort of racism on an almost daily basis.</p><p>The hope is that this app will connect with young students, alleviate prejudgments via exposure, and equip them with the tools to deal with internalized biases.</p><p>Watch this video to get an idea of how racism <a href="https://youtu.be/QRZPw-9sJtQ" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://youtu.be/QRZPw-9sJtQ&apos;, &apos;affects kids&apos;);">affects kids</a>:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QRZPw-9sJtQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
