<p>By a margin of 5-3, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruled that police officers can still arrest someone for an outstanding warrant, even if the officer unlawfully stopped that person in the first place, because to hell with due process, right?</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>The decision in&#xA0;<em><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/utah-v-strieff/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/utah-v-strieff/&apos;, &apos;Utah v. Strieff&apos;);">Utah v. Strieff</a>&#xA0;</em>comes down to the Fourth Amendment&#x2019;s exclusionary rule and stems from an incident that took place in South Salt Lake, Utah in 2006. Edward Strieff left a friend&#x2019;s house and was followed by police officer Douglas Fackrell. The officer had Strieff&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s house under surveillance due to an anonymous call about unspecified drug activity taking place in the house. Officer Fackrell pulled Strieff over without cause and ran his identification, discovering that Strieff had a warrant for a minor traffic violation. Officer Fackrell searched Strieff, finding contraband and methamphetamine on him.</p><p>At a suppression hearing, prosecutors acknowledged that Officer Fackrell <a href="http://fox13now.com/2015/10/01/u-s-supreme-court-will-hear-utah-case-involving-drug-search/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://fox13now.com/2015/10/01/u-s-supreme-court-will-hear-utah-case-involving-drug-search/&apos;, &apos;had no reason to pull Strieff over&apos;);">had no reason to pull Strieff over</a>, but successfully argued that even though the contraband and methamphetamine were found as a result of an illegal search, they were admissible in court. The Utah Supreme Court weighed in on the issue during an appeal, wherein they said &#x201C;slow your role&#x201D; and deemed the contraband and drugs inadmissible.</p><p>The final appeal up to the Supreme Court determined, as explained in Justice Clarence Thomas&#x2019; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;pageview&apos;, &apos;http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf&apos;);">majority opinion</a>, the even though the stop was unlawful, the search for those drugs was legitimized by the discovery of the warrant for Strieff&#x2019;s traffic violation.</p><div id="attachment_138418" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-138418" src="http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/384px-Sonia_Sotomayor_in_SCOTUS_robe-350x438.jpg?resize=350%2C438" alt="scotus sotomayor decision fourth amendment constitution police discrimination" srcset="http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/384px-Sonia_Sotomayor_in_SCOTUS_robe.jpg 350w, http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/384px-Sonia_Sotomayor_in_SCOTUS_robe.jpg 64w, http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/384px-Sonia_Sotomayor_in_SCOTUS_robe.jpg 384w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined in part by The Notorious R.B.G., pointed out that SCOTUS&#x2019; decision has effectively justified the open season policy many police officers have used to pull over African-Americans and Latinos without cause. Justice Sotomayor <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/06/20/3790300/sotomayor-dissent-illegal-stops/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/06/20/3790300/sotomayor-dissent-illegal-stops/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a> of the decision:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>&#x201C;This Court has given officers an array of instruments to probe and examine you. This Court has allowed an officer to stop you for whatever reason he wants &#x2014; so long as he can point to a pretextual justification after the fact. That justification must provide specific reasons why the officer suspected you were breaking the law, but it may factor in your ethnicity, where you live, what you were wearing, and how you behaved. The officer does not even need to know which law you might have broken so long as he can later point to any possible infraction &#x2014; even one that is minor, unrelated, or ambiguous.&#x201D;</em></p><p>That is horrifying. Considering the events that have been revealed in places like Ferguson, Mo., decisions like this reinforce the idea that the United States is slowly becoming a police state. Justice Sotomayor paints a terrifying picture of a nation where your race is cause to pull you over and find something to justify your arrest. It may not even be restricted to race, but could also be used to justify harassing the poor, the LGBT community, and other demographics toward which an officer may harbor discriminatory views.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>SCOTUS may have just opened the door for further discriminatory behavior by police nationwide. The problem is already bad enough and does not need an adrenaline shot.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vp_UDNJR8OA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured image via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq2ZF145wWM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq2ZF145wWM&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);">YouTube</a>.</em></p><p><em>h/t <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/06/20/3790300/sotomayor-dissent-illegal-stops/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/06/20/3790300/sotomayor-dissent-illegal-stops/&apos;, &apos;ThinkProgress&apos;);">ThinkProgress</a></em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
