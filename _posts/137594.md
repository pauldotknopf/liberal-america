<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>No doubt you still recall that infamous filibuster which Texas Senator Ted Cruz conducted in 2013 as part of a completely failed effort to defund the Affordable Care Act. He even shut down the government and ticked off many of his Republican Senate colleagues, including John McCain, who called Cruz a &#x201C;wacko bird.&#x201D;</p><p>And now we have Teddy the Hypocrite from Hell <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-who-read-dr-seuss-on-senate-floor-attacks-dems-for-ridiculous-anti-gun-filibuster/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-who-read-dr-seuss-on-senate-floor-attacks-dems-for-ridiculous-anti-gun-filibuster/&apos;, &apos;taking to the floor&apos;);" target="_blank">taking to the floor</a> of the Senate to criticize the Democrats for daring to conduct a filibuster over the issue of weapons of war&#x2013;semiautomatic rifles&#x2013;being available to anyone who wants to buy one, even if that person is on a terrorist watch list. Because hey, terrorists have a right to a gun, too, according to Cruz and his paymasters at the NRA.</p><p>Cruz began his criticism of Senator Chris Murphy and other Democrats by referencing the massacre which took place on Orlando, <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-who-read-dr-seuss-on-senate-floor-attacks-dems-for-ridiculous-anti-gun-filibuster/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-who-read-dr-seuss-on-senate-floor-attacks-dems-for-ridiculous-anti-gun-filibuster/&apos;, &apos;declaring&apos;);" target="_blank">declaring</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;In the wake of the attack, many of us predicted what would unfold. And it was sadly the same political tale we have seen over and over again. Many of us predicted that Democrats would as a matter of rigid partisan ideology refuse to even say with the words &#x2018;radical Islamic terrorism.&#x2019;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;And that even worse, they would try to use it as an excuse to go after the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. Yesterday, we saw a political show on the Senate floor. Democrat after Democrat standing for hours incensed not at ISIS, incensed not at radical Islamic terrorism, incensed that Americans have a right to keep and bear arms.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Yep, the same dillhole who read &#x201C;Green Eggs and Ham&#x201D; as part of his filibuster is now upset with his colleagues for daring to actually address an important issue which impacts the safety of us all in the United States. This Lone Star bullshit artist <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-who-read-dr-seuss-on-senate-floor-attacks-dems-for-ridiculous-anti-gun-filibuster/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-who-read-dr-seuss-on-senate-floor-attacks-dems-for-ridiculous-anti-gun-filibuster/&apos;, &apos;then said&apos;);" target="_blank">then said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;And I think the American people find it ridiculous. That in response to an ISIS terror attack the Democrats go on high dungeon that we&#x2019;ve got to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t defeat terrorism by taking away our guns. You defeat terrorism by using our guns.&#x201D;</em></p><p>And do you know how you defeat ignorant, blowhard douchebags who cannot even recognize a real threat to this country when they see it? You call them out and shame them, just like this. Shame on you, Ted. Take your bags of money from the merchants of death at the NRA and shut the hell up.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s Teddy being all outraged:</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/iWzVh_cZy1o?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured Image Via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/8004836220" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/8004836220&apos;, &apos;Gage Skidmore for Flickr&apos;);" target="_blank">Gage Skidmore for Flickr</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&apos;, &apos;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic&apos;);" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic</a> License</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p>
