<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Last week, Donald Trump was embroiled on the controversy over his incredibly offensive comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University trial, and this week Trump has once again stepped into a giant pile of dung with his comments following the shooting in Orlando. So it should come as no surprise that a new poll shows Hillary Clinton pulling away in the race for the White House.</p><p>An&#xA0;<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12&apos;, &apos;NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll&apos;);" target="_blank">NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll</a> released this morning shows Clinton now ahead of Trump by a margin of 49 percent to 42 percent. But the truly sobering news for the Trump camp lies beyond the headline of the seven point differential.</p><p>In just one week,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12&apos;, &apos;Clinton has narrowed&apos;);" target="_blank">Clinton has narrowed</a> Trump&#x2019;s lead among men and white voters to single digits and leads Trump by 25 points &#x2014; 58 percent to 33 percent &#x2014; among voters who describe&#xA0;themselves as moderate. Trump led among male voters by 14 points in last week&#x2019;s survey, but now leads by only 9 points in this week&#x2019;s poll &#x2014; 51 percent to 42 percent. And among white voters&#x2013;seen as key to Trump having any chance of winning in November&#x2013;Trump&#x2019;s lead shrank to 9 points, 50 percent to 41 percent.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12&apos;, &apos;NBC poll&apos;);" target="_blank">NBC poll</a> also surveyed respondents on a possible four-way Presidential race, including Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. In that scenario, Clinton still wins,&#xA0;leading Trump 42 percent to 38 percent, compared with last week, when she trailed 40 percent to 39 percent. Johnson received 9 percent support, and Stein drew 5 percent.</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.scribd.com/doc/315612407/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-6-6-6-12&apos;, &apos;most telling number&apos;);" target="_blank">most telling number</a> may be this one: a majority of 54 percent said they think Clinton will win the general election, while only 40 percent said they believe that Trump will win.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Since Trump cannot seem to control his mouth and make the pivot to general election candidate, it seems likely that Clinton&#x2019;s lead will continue to increase in the weeks ahead.</p><p><em>Featured Image Via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw9cYiNPCYE" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw9cYiNPCYE&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);" target="_blank">YouTube</a> Screengrab</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
