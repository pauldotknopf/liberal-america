<p>It seems the Trump name is in a legal battle once again, but this time Ivanka is the Trump under scrutiny. <a href="https://www.aquazzura.com/en" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.aquazzura.com/en&apos;, &apos;Aquazzura&apos;);">Aquazzura</a>, an Italian fashion company founded by designer Edgardo Osorio, has filed a lawsuit against Ivanka Trump and her business partner Marc Fisher.</p><p>The lawsuit is for allegedly knocking off some of Aquazzura&#x2019;s most famous shoe designs. The lawsuit <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/ivanka-trump-sued-luxury-sandals" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/ivanka-trump-sued-luxury-sandals&apos;, &apos;also accuses&apos;);">also accuses</a> Ivanka&#x2019;s company of:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Seeking the same success Aquazzura experienced, but without having to put in the hard creative work.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Ivanka Trump and Marc Fisher started the shoe and handbag specialty in 2010, just three years after launching her jewelry collection. Her website attempts to draw in the &#x201C;working woman&#x201D; in all areas of their lives. Ivanka&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.ivankatrump.com/about/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.ivankatrump.com/about/&apos;, &apos;website&apos;);">website</a> states:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C; It&#x2019;s a celebration of women working at all aspects of their lives. Women who transition between their various roles in professional and personal capacities: building careers, raising children, nurturing relationships and pursuing passions.&#x201D;</em></p><p>For a company boasting hard working successful women, it seems a little hypocritical to be stealing other designer&#x2019;s ideas and selling them as their own.</p><p>One of the highlighted designs in Osorio&#x2019;s celebrated collection is named &#x201C;Wild Thing,&#x201D; and looks suspiciously similar to Ivanka&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hettie&#x201D; sandal. The picture below shows both sandals side by side, Ivanka&#x2019;s sandal looking almost identical to Aquazzura&#x2019;s.</p><div id="attachment_139270" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/side-by-side-wild-thing.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-139270" src="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/side-by-side-wild-thing-600x276.png?resize=600%2C276" alt="Photo Courtesy of Buzzfeed" srcset="//cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/side-by-side-wild-thing.png 600w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/side-by-side-wild-thing.png 64w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/side-by-side-wild-thing.png 350w, //cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/side-by-side-wild-thing.png 625w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>
