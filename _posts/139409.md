<p>This epically funny Australian <a href="http://democraticreview.com/index.php/2016/06/26/this-australian-anti-trump-ad-is-so-brutal-it-was-banned-in-america-but-now-its-gone-viral/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://democraticreview.com/index.php/2016/06/26/this-australian-anti-trump-ad-is-so-brutal-it-was-banned-in-america-but-now-its-gone-viral/&apos;, &apos;advertisemen&apos;);" target="_blank">advertisemen</a>t is poking fun at Donald Trump&#x2019;s wall. The commercial is for a new 360-degree camera called 360Fly. The premise is that Trump is president (I know it&#x2019;s scary) and he&#x2019;s unveiling his wall.</p><p>He&#x2019;s talking about how great it is and how it will keep the Mexicans out of the country.</p><p>However, you can see people climbing up a hole from underneath the wall. One of them even uses leaf blowers and flies himself over the wall.&#xA0;Unfortunately, the Mexican people portrayed in the commercial are racist caricatures of Mexican stereotypes. Many networks have banned it.</p><p>Peter Adderton, 360Fly&#x2019;s CEO, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/new-tech-ad-satirizes-trump-his-wall-and-mexican-immigrants/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnet.com/news/new-tech-ad-satirizes-trump-his-wall-and-mexican-immigrants/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I was honestly shocked when some networks said no. This ad isn&#x2019;t so edgy. It&#x2019;s an open message.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The networks that banned the commercial refused to elaborate on why. However, it is likely that they wanted to stay politically neutral.</p><p>Mike Nelson, a spokesman for KCBS-TV, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-trump-border-wall-360fly-commercial-20160622-snap-story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-trump-border-wall-360fly-commercial-20160622-snap-story.html&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s our policy not to comment on specific spots, but all spots are reviewed to ensure that they meet the standards and expectations of our local viewing audience.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Adderton also&#xA0;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-trump-border-wall-360fly-commercial-20160622-snap-story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-trump-border-wall-360fly-commercial-20160622-snap-story.html&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I talk to Republicans and Democrats and independents, and everyone has got a singular point of view and is not willing to look at others&#x2019; point of view.
