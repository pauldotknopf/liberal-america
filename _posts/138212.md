<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>In case you missed it, <a href="/2016/06/20/breaking-trump-fires-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski/" target="_blank">earlier this morning</a> Donald Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and did so with a terse statement his press secretary gave the media which read:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign.&#xA0;The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Within minutes of the announcement that Lewandowski was out, speculation began: Was he let go because Trump&#x2019;s poll numbers are tanking, or was there another reason? Did Lewandowski finally do or say something that made Trump decide he was expendable?</p><p>As it turns out, <em>New York</em> Magazine <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/trump-kids-ousted-corey-lewandowski.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/trump-kids-ousted-corey-lewandowski.html&apos;, &apos;is reporting&apos;);" target="_blank">is reporting</a> that Lewandowski was ousted by the Trump children. And Ivanka Trump, who co-starred with her father on the show &#x201C;Celebrity Apprentice&#x201D; was the one who pulled the most weight:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Earlier Monday morning, Donald Trump and his adult children gathered for a regular strategy meeting at Trump Tower. Also present was Corey Lewandowski, the campaign&#x2019;s embattled manager. According to one senior Trump staffer briefed on the meeting, &#x2018;things went south for Lewandowski, and he was fired.&#x2019; Shortly after, he was escorted out by security. Paul Manafort, Trump&#x2019;s campaign manager, is now fully in charge.&#x201D;</em></p><p>What led to this sudden turn of events? NBC&#x2019;s Katy Tur, who has been covering the Trump campaign for months now, says Ivanka has been angry with Lewandowski ever since alleged assault of former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was Ivanka the final say? &#x2026; <br>&#x2013;&gt; <a href="https://t.co/HEMV59NYql" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/HEMV59NYql&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/HEMV59NYql&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/HEMV59NYql</a></p>
