<p>The Duggar family, stars of the now cancelled TLC show&#xA0;<em>19 Kids &amp; Counting,</em> are extremely religious and conservative. They have spread plenty of LGBT hate over the years. They are known for their strict <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/10/11-strange-facts-duggar-family-parenting-video/">parenting rules</a> as well. They don&#x2019;t allow the girls to wear pants. They don&#x2019;t allow any children to go on a date without a chaperone. The parents must be included in every text.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Well, this Sunday, our country experienced the <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/12/50-confirmed-dead-53-wounded-worst-mass-shooting-us-history/" target="_blank">worst mass shooting</a> in history. 50 people died and 53 people were wounded in a shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The shooter was a Muslim and a homophobe.</p><p>Jessa Duggar and her husband, Ben Seewald are speaking out after this tragedy. They are posting quotes from anti-LGBT preachers.</p><p>One of the quotes was from Christian Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. Jessa shared the post where he&#xA0;<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/duggar-daughter-responds-to-orlando-attack-with-messages-from-anti-lgbt-pastors/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/duggar-daughter-responds-to-orlando-attack-with-messages-from-anti-lgbt-pastors/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;This is when we show that Christians mourn with those who mourn.

It is from Calvinist Baptist Preacher John Piper:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Through tears.

They offered prayers, but in a very homophobic way. They posted this Bible verse:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. James 4:7-8.&#x201D;</em></p><p>They did not provide a specific motive behind the verse, so people are interpreting it in different ways. This does imply that the victims brought the attack on themselves by failing to &#x201C;resist the devil.&#x201D; This screwed up family should just shut up if they can&#x2019;t show a hint of compassion.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KQ1--GsK3WA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><em>Featured image via YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy8O-hCx5eY" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy8O-hCx5eY&apos;, &apos;screengrab&apos;);" target="_blank">screengrab</a>.</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
