<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Trevor Noah talked about my home state of Alabama on <em>The Daily Show</em> <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g96e6a/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-scandals-in-alabama-s-three-highest-offices" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g96e6a/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-scandals-in-alabama-s-three-highest-offices&apos;, &apos;last night&apos;);">last night</a>. He mentioned scandals involving the former Speaker of the House, Republican Mark Hubbard, the Republican Governor, Robert Bentley, and the Chief Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, also a Republican.</p><p>First, let&#x2019;s look at Gov. Bentley, who was <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/03/28/pervy-alabama-gop-governor-refuses-resign/" target="_blank">involved</a> in a sex scandal around one of his former advisers. He got caught having an affair with one of his staffers. He refused to resign, even after the audio from his phone calls to his mistress&#xA0;came out.</p><p>The woman, Rebekah Mason, was an adviser paid by a third party, so there was some stink around that issue as well. When asked about the affair, the governor&#xA0;<a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/jhoa9q/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-breaking-down-alabama-s-government-scandals" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/jhoa9q/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-breaking-down-alabama-s-government-scandals&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I love many members of my staff&#x2026; Do I love some more than others? Absolutely.&#x201D;</em></p><p>He is basically saying that he did have the affair. He is not denying it, but he is doubling down on it.</p><p>An example of&#xA0;the <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/04/08/alabama-governor-robert-bentley-recording/" target="_blank">creepiness</a> from his&#xA0;phone calls with Mason includes this one:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You&#x2019;d kiss me? I love that. You know I do love that. You know what? When I stand behind you and I put my arms around you, and I put my hands on your breasts, and I put my hands on you and pull you in real close. Hey, I love that, too.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Former Speaker Hubbard was found <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g96e6a/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-scandals-in-alabama-s-three-highest-offices" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g96e6a/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-scandals-in-alabama-s-three-highest-offices&apos;, &apos;guilty&apos;);" target="_blank">guilty</a> of corruption. In politics for 18 years, Hubbard has a radio show, and even his own magazines. He was convicted of 12 counts of corruption for funneling money into his printing company.</p><p>Yes, a printing company in 2016. Such such a great place to put your money&#x2026;</p><p>Chief Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore has long been against same-sex marriage. He has tried to shove his religion into politics for years. We heard some good news about him, recently.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>He finally got <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/07/last-alabama-chief-justice-suspended-failing-obey-ruling-sex-marriage/" target="_blank">suspended</a> for not obeying the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage.</p><p>When the ruling came down, Justice Moore actually ordered his judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He blatantly ignored the Supreme Court&#x2019;s ruling.</p><p>Yes, we have some problems in my state, as <em>The Daily Show</em> pointed out, but at least Trevor Noah can put a funny spin on it to distract us from how tragic&#xA0;this is.</p><p>View Trevor Noah&#x2019;s Alabama <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g96e6a/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-scandals-in-alabama-s-three-highest-offices" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g96e6a/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-scandals-in-alabama-s-three-highest-offices&apos;, &apos;corruption &apos;);">corruption </a>segment on <em>The Daily Show:</em></p><div style="background-color: #000000; width: 520px;">
