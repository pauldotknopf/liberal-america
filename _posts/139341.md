<p>You are not going to believe this. These parents in Texas <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/25/tx-supreme-court-sides-with-homeschooling-parents-who-didnt-teach-their-kids-due-to-the-rapture/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/25/tx-supreme-court-sides-with-homeschooling-parents-who-didnt-teach-their-kids-due-to-the-rapture/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook&apos;, &apos;refused&apos;);" target="_blank">refused</a> to educate their nine children because they feel that the Rapture is imminent. They pulled all of the children out of private school and started &#x201C;homeschooling&#x201D; them. What is the really scary part? The Texas Supreme Court ruled in their favor.</p><p>The case involved Laura and Michael McIntyre. They pulled all nine their children out of their private school in 2004. Michael&#x2019;s brother, Tracy, said that he never saw the children with any books or learning materials when they were supposed to be learning. Tracy overheard one of the kids say that they weren&#x2019;t doing any school work because they were about to be &#x201C;raptured.&#x201D;</p><p>They used a previous case to argue their point.&#xA0;<em>Wisconsin v.

The program must meet &#x201C;basic educational goals&#x201D; in varied subjects. The kids don&#x2019;t have to take any tests for it, though.</p><p>The family&#x2019;s eldest daughter, 17-year-old Tori, ran away from them to return to school.</p><p>Tracy McIntyre <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/texas/article/Texas-Supreme-Court-sidesteps-key-home-school-8323191.php" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.sfgate.com/news/texas/article/Texas-Supreme-Court-sidesteps-key-home-school-8323191.php&apos;, &apos;complained&apos;);" target="_blank">complained</a> to the school district that the children were not being educated.
