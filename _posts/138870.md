</div><p>This led to this innocent Muslim mother being thrown against the wall and punched multiple times &#x2013; in front of her four-month-old son.

But right now we&#x2019;re looking at it as an assault.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>She also said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re asking anybody who saw or heard anything to let us know.
