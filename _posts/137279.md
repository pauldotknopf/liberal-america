<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Donald Trump and his squadron of lunatic supporters believe that it&#x2019;s possible to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/6/13/1538377/--Radical-Islamic-Terrorism-3-Magic-Words-Trump-And-The-GOP-Use-To-Suck-In-The-Stupid" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/6/13/1538377/--Radical-Islamic-Terrorism-3-Magic-Words-Trump-And-The-GOP-Use-To-Suck-In-The-Stupid&apos;, &apos;defeat terrorists with magic words&apos;);">defeat terrorists with magic words</a>. Just say &#x201C;Radical Islam!&#x201D; and poof! All the bad guys disappear.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not the only magic they can do, either. They can change reality so&#xA0;completely that up becomes down and small becomes huge.</p><p><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-backer-john-bolton-obama-unqualified-because-snark-in-a-president-not-an-admirable-trait/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-backer-john-bolton-obama-unqualified-because-snark-in-a-president-not-an-admirable-trait/&apos;, &apos;RawStory&apos;);">RawStory</a> is reporting on one event in which reality was completely contorted to meet the view of the Trumpsters.</p><p>Read&#xA0;this quote from John Bolton, the former Ambassador to the United Nations, and a big Trump fan. In a speech just yesterday Bolton said:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1"><em>&#x201C;We get a lecture from one of the most narcissistic individuals ever to hold that job about what&#x2019;s wrong with the rest of us who don&#x2019;t have the tolerance that he does. Instead of talking about the enemies of the United States and what he&#x2019;s going to do, he talks about his political enemies. I just think that&#x2019;s unpresidential, I think it shows the president to be a small man.</em>&#x201D;</span></p><p class="p1">If you read this quickly, of course, you would be convinced that it refers to none other than Donald J. Trump, right? &#xA0;A whole fleet of <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists&apos;, &apos;mental health professionals&apos;);">mental health professionals</a> have declared Trump to be suffering from narcissistic personality disorder.</p><p class="p1">As for &#x201C;talking about his political enemies,&#x201D; I think that pretty much sums up the entire Trump campaign, don&#x2019;t you?</p><p class="p1">It gets even more hilarious, though. When talking about the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/obama-pushes-back-against-criticism-over-terrorism-rhetoric/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/obama-pushes-back-against-criticism-over-terrorism-rhetoric/&apos;, &apos;President\&apos;s speech yesterday&apos;);">President&#x2019;s speech yesterday</a>, in which POTUS&#xA0;reminded people that just saying the words &#x201C;radical Islam&#x201D; would not defeat ISIS, Bolton managed to keep a straight face as he <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-backer-john-bolton-obama-unqualified-because-snark-in-a-president-not-an-admirable-trait/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-backer-john-bolton-obama-unqualified-because-snark-in-a-president-not-an-admirable-trait/&apos;, &apos;stated&apos;);">stated</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Snark in a President is not an admirable trait.&#x201D;&#xA0;</em></p><p class="p1">After my head stopped spinning, I went to look up the definition of snark. I thought that maybe the word implied a certain nuance and subtlety that is lacking in Trump&#x2019;s verbal assaults. That would explain how Bolton could accuse Obama of snark without seeing it in his hero, Donald J. Trump.</p><p class="p1">Here is what I found, on the <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/snark" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/snark&apos;, &apos;Merriam-Webster&apos;);">Merriam-Webster</a> site:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;snark-an attitude or expression of mocking irreverence and sarcasm&#x201D;</em></p><div id="attachment_137283" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-137283 size-medium" src="http://i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-15-at-9.21.33-AM-350x228.png?resize=350%2C228" alt="Screen Shot 2016-06-15 at 9.21.33 AM" srcset="http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-15-at-9.21.33-AM.png 350w, http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-15-at-9.21.33-AM.png 64w, http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-15-at-9.21.33-AM.png 528w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1">
