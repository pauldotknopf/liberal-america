While attempting to escape the gunfire, McGill came across a wounded man.</p><p>Thinking quickly, McGill removed his shirt and used it to tourniquet at least two bullet wounds. The two men then dodged and weaved their way to safety, finally reaching the responding police officers.</p><p>McGill and the man, who said his name was Rodney, hopped in the nearest police car to get the injured man immediate medical care. While in the car, McGill used his medical knowledge and the <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/06/nursing-student-pulse-stopped-running-life-save-stranger/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/06/nursing-student-pulse-stopped-running-life-save-stranger/&apos;, &apos;officer\&apos;s instructions&apos;);" target="_blank">officer&#x2019;s instructions</a> to keep Rodney alive:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;While we were in the car, the police officer was telling me to keep him conscious by asking him questions, and applying pressure&#x2026;&#x201D;</em></p><p>Once the car reached the hospital, Rodney was admitted for medical care and the two men then parted ways. Afterwards, McGill reached out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joshua.mcgill1990/posts/1220433711309944" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/joshua.mcgill1990/posts/1220433711309944&apos;, &apos;Facebook&apos;);" target="_blank">Facebook</a> in an attempt to find out if the stranger he saved had made it:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It sucks because all I got was his name and I can&#x2019;t even see if he&#x2019;s okay because I&#x2019;m not related. If anyone knows of a guy named Rodney that was shot and injured tonight.. Please let me know he is okay. I felt God put me at the club and made me stay behind to help a complete stranger. For whatever reason that may be.. I don&#x2019;t know, but I do know it was hopefully to save his life. Maybe God be with us all in this time of need.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>In an interview with &#x201C;Good Morning America&#x201D; this morning, McGill said that he had managed to get in contact with some of Rodney&#x2019;s relatives, and was told that he is alive and was in surgery this morning.</p><p>A moment of true heroism on such a dark night. Way to go, Joshua.</p><p>Watch McGill&#x2019;s interview here:</p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fPeVCftvACI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
