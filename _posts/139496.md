<p>Donald Trump is a bully and a braggart. To hear him tell it, he has the best of everything: the best hotel, the best clothes, the best itty bitty tiny hands ever seen on a man. And yet his multiple business failures&#x2013;Trump steaks, Trump vodka, Trump publications, Trump University&#x2013;would seem to suggest that the claims of greatness are little more than hot air, which he has an abundance of.</p><p>Having said that, you would probably expect that man who says he&#x2019;s worth $10 billion (but won&#x2019;t release his tax returns to prove it) would be quite generous when it comes to what he gives to charity. But you would be wrong.</p><p>The Washington <em>Post</em> did an in-depth investigation of Trump&#x2019;s donations over a seven-year period, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&apos;, &apos;they found&apos;);" target="_blank">they found</a> all of one contribution to the Police Athletic League in&#xA0;2009. The amount of that donation was between $5,000 and $9,999. Other than that, no other charitable gifts show up in a period which stretches from 2008 until May of this year. So let&#x2019;s call it $10,000 over seven years. That averages out to about $1,428 a year. How&#x2019;s that for generous.</p><p>Now, it should be noted that Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&apos;, &apos;indeed given millions&apos;);" target="_blank">indeed given millions</a>&#x2013;$3.8 million to be exact&#x2013;through his foundation, but that money was dispersed over a 15 year period.

But he gave less to those causes than he did to his eldest daughter&#x2019;s ballet school. How&#x2019;s that for being one hell of a guy?</p><p>From 1987 to 1991, here&#x2019;s a look at Trump&#x2019;s giving to charity:</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139518" src="//i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trumpcharity_tearsheet.jpg" alt="trumpcharity_tearsheet" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The total <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&apos;, &apos;given via his foundation&apos;);" target="_blank">given via his foundation</a> for that five-year period: $143,700.</p><p>And yet, whenever Trump is asked where the profits from one of his ventures will be going (because what does a billionaire need with a few extra million?), the response is always the same: To charity, of course. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&apos;, &apos;For example&apos;);" target="_blank">For example</a>:</p><ul>
<li>In 2008, Trump <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20081006005543/en/Trump-Super-Premium-Vodka-Holiday-Program-Support" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20081006005543/en/Trump-Super-Premium-Vodka-Holiday-Program-Support&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" title="www.businesswire.com" target="_blank" shape="rect">said</a> that he would send proceeds from sales of Trump Super Premium Vodka to the <a href="http://www.walterreedsociety.org/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.walterreedsociety.org/&apos;, &apos;Walter Reed Society&apos;);" title="www.walterreedsociety.org" target="_blank" shape="rect">Walter Reed Society</a>, which helps wounded military personnel. John Pierce, one of the group&#x2019;s board members, recalls receiving &#x201C;a few hundred dollars.&#x201D;</li>
<li>In 2011, Trump pledged to forgo his appearance fee for a televised &#x201C;roast.&#x201D; The Trump Foundation&#x2019;s tax filings show a $400,000 donation from Comedy Central instead.</li>
</ul><p>So, let&#x2019;s sum this up in a few words that can be clearly understood, even by Trump&#x2019;s brainless supporters: Donald Trump is a lying sack of human excrement who wants people to think he&#x2019;s generous, but who cannot back up his claims. And this alone tells us all we need to know about this vile man. He isn&#x2019;t fit to collect the garbage, let alone be President of the United States.</p>
