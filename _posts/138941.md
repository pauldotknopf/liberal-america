<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>&#x201C;Enough Is Enough&#x201D; is the name John Cramsey chose for his drug-abuse <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/21/gun-nuts-drove-monster-truck-to-nyc-to-rescue-heroin-addict.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/21/gun-nuts-drove-monster-truck-to-nyc-to-rescue-heroin-addict.html&apos;, &apos;rescue group&apos;);">rescue group</a>. Having suffered the loss of his 20-year-old daughter to a heroin overdose, Cramsey and a group of concerned friends banded together and committed to take action against heroin abuse.</p><p>Unfortunately for Cramsey, the group disbanded after he and two accomplices were arrested in the midst of a &#x201C;rescue mission.&#x201D; The threesome was armed with an assault rifle, 12-gauge shotgun, and five pistols, but it was likely their choice of vehicle that caught the attention of the NYPD.</p><p>Cramsey&#x2019;s lifted, zombie-defense-force themed Dodge Ram is hard to miss, and it had a cracked windshield.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div id="attachment_138961" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-138961" src="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Vigilante-dad-e1466783156871.png?resize=800%2C451" alt="gun crime" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>Police explain that the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/21/gun-nuts-drove-monster-truck-to-nyc-to-rescue-heroin-addict.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/21/gun-nuts-drove-monster-truck-to-nyc-to-rescue-heroin-addict.html&apos;, &apos;mission&#x2019;s objective&apos;);">mission&#x2019;s objective</a> was to rescue a 16-year-old heroin-addicted female held against her will by drug dealers in Brooklyn. Also worth noting is the fact that police identified Cramsey and his two passengers as heavy heroin users themselves.</p><p>With almost <a href="http://www.sandstonecare.com/sandstones-blog/the-connection-between-drug-abuse-and-troubled-teens/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.sandstonecare.com/sandstones-blog/the-connection-between-drug-abuse-and-troubled-teens/&apos;, &apos;50 percent&apos;);">50 percent</a>&#xA0;of high school students using some form&#xA0;of addictive substance, Cramsey certainly is not the only parent disturbed at the state of things. He may be the most extreme, though.</p><p>Among the weapons cache loaded into his Ram, police discovered ammo boxes adorned with &#x201C;shoot your local heroin dealer.&#x201D;</p><p>Whether Cramsey and friends would have actually resorted to violence, we&#x2019;ll never know, but the idea of <a href="http://gawker.com/giant-gun-arsenal-proves-unhelpful-in-vigilantes-rescu-1782436717?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gawker%2Ffull+(Gawker)" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://gawker.com/giant-gun-arsenal-proves-unhelpful-in-vigilantes-rescu-1782436717?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gawker%2Ffull+(Gawker)&apos;, &apos;gun-toting&apos;);">gun-toting</a>&#xA0;heroin addicts bringing war on one another Mad Max style is scary enough unrealized.</p><p>One of the people travelling with Cramsey was 29-year-old Kimberly Walker, mother of an 8-year-old. Walker&#x2019;s mother describes her as having never even fired a gun. Had Cramsey and Walker made it to their destination, Walker&#x2019;s first time firing a gun could have come while taking fire. It could never have come at all.</p><p>It&#x2019;s fun to watch movies where the good guys saddle up and bring justice to those who&#x2019;ve wronged them.</p><p>Cramsey&#x2019;s posse saw themselves as doing exactly that, but in reality, their actions placed themselves and many more in danger. Rather than saving a life, several could have been lost in the gun crime of the century.</p><p>In a nation with working gun control, this situation simply does not happen. It is shocking to think that after witnessing the nation&#x2019;s deadliest <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/12/50-confirmed-dead-53-wounded-worst-mass-shooting-us-history/">mass shooting</a> on record this month in Orlando, there are still examples of citizens arming themselves with assault weapons, convinced they are going to &#x201C;make a difference.&#x201D;</p><p>Reality is not the movies, and for Cramsey to think it&#x2019;s acceptable that he murders drug dealers to &#x201C;make a difference,&#x201D; when doing so does nothing for either the 16-year-old he set out to rescue, or his late daughter, is absurd.</p><p>Rationalized gun violence is still gun violence.</p><p>The ease with which individuals acquire <a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/167502-how-many-mass-shootings-were-ar-15-rifles-involved-in-its-not-the-only-semiautomatic-rifle-on" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.bustle.com/articles/167502-how-many-mass-shootings-were-ar-15-rifles-involved-in-its-not-the-only-semiautomatic-rifle-on&apos;, &apos;assault weapons&apos;);">assault weapons</a>&#xA0;like Cramsey&#x2019;s, and those used at Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, and other tragic incidents means that rationalized murder can become mass murder in a matter of seconds.</p><p>It&#x2019;s true that making such weapons illegal won&#x2019;t keep them from falling into the wrong hands, but the current state of things almost ensures that they will.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Not everyone who uses heroin dies, but in 2014 there were <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates&apos;, &apos;more than&apos;);">more than</a> 11,000 deaths attributed to heroin overdose, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p><p>The government&#xA0;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/opinion/branson-end-war-on-drugs/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/opinion/branson-end-war-on-drugs/&apos;, &apos;spent trillions&apos;);">spent trillions</a> fighting drug cartels to avoid more deaths.
