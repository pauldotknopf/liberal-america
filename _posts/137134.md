</div><p>Chris W. Cox, the NRA&#x2019;s lobbying director, wrote an op-ed in the USA Today, and in that compilation of ridiculously&#xA0;twisted logic, Cox <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/06/13/gun-laws-deter-terrorists-opposing-view/85844946/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/06/13/gun-laws-deter-terrorists-opposing-view/85844946/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;In the aftermath of this terrorist attack, President Obama and Hillary Clinton renewed calls for more gun control, including a ban on whole categories of semi-automatic firearms. They are desperate to create the illusion that they&#x2019;re doing something to protect us because their policies can&#x2019;t and won&#x2019;t keep us safe. This transparent head-fake should scare every American, because it will do nothing to prevent the next attack.&#x201D;</span></em></p><p class="p1">As a side note, this guy presumably helped the NRA to bribe&#xA0;Republican Senators into&#xA0;defeating the Manchin-Toomey bill&#xA0;after the murders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p><p class="p1">Cox&#xA0;went on to accuse the FBI of failing to arrest the shooter when they investigated him in 2013 and 2014. The truth is, they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/omar-mateen-fbi.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/omar-mateen-fbi.html&apos;, &apos;didn\&apos;t arrest him&apos;);">didn&#x2019;t arrest him</a> because he hadn&#x2019;t committed any crime. There was no evidence that he was planning one.</p><p class="p1">The NRA still seems to think that the Obama administration should have grabbed and held him.</p><p class="p1">The NRA seems to believe that we should&#xA0;arrest anyone who speaks against the government or uses threatening, racist language. That would certainly put Donald Trump at considerable risk.</p><p class="p1">Of course, the NRA won&#x2019;t say that there was&#xA0;significant evidence that the murderer was mentally confused. During the investigation by the FBI, the man claimed allegiance to every Islamist group he could think of, completely ignoring the fact that <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/06/13/orlando_shooter_supported_conflicting_islamist_groups_that_are_fighting_each_other/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.salon.com/2016/06/13/orlando_shooter_supported_conflicting_islamist_groups_that_are_fighting_each_other/&apos;, &apos;many of them are sworn enemies&apos;);">many of them are sworn enemies</a>.</p><p class="p1">He obviously wasn&#x2019;t highly involved with ISIS or any other group since he couldn&#x2019;t even tell them apart.</p><p class="p1">His ex-wife also claimed that he was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/orlando-massacre-omar-mateens-ex-wife-says-he-beat-her-and-held-her-hostage" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/orlando-massacre-omar-mateens-ex-wife-says-he-beat-her-and-held-her-hostage&apos;, &apos;physically abusive and prone to violent rages&apos;);">physically abusive and prone to violent rages</a>.
