While his recent internet exploits will no doubt make him a local attraction, he has already made a name for himself by being vehemently&#xA0;anti-LGBT.</p><p>The 40-year-old pastor regularly preaches about members of the LGBT community being an abomination. He was arrested in May after a watchdog organization tipped off the police.</p><p>With the help of the&#xA0;<a href="http://www.missingkids.com/home" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.missingkids.com/home&apos;, &apos;National Center for Missing and Exploited Children&apos;);">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a>,&#xA0;Reynolds&#x2019; social media accounts were found to have, &#x201C;explicit material featuring children.&#x201D;</p><p>While he is no longer working for that church, in a <a href="http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/former-sherwood-pastor-arrested-in-child-porn-case" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/former-sherwood-pastor-arrested-in-child-porn-case&apos;, &apos;public statement&apos;);" target="_blank">public statement</a>&#xA0;the church said:</p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;On March 7th, the elders of Cornerstone removed Dave Reynolds from all responsibility at Cornerstone. Dave had informed two of the elders that he was engaged in pornography and thought the elders might learn of this from another party, </em>hence<em> he decided to inform us of his involvement in this sin. Those two elders specifically asked Dave if he had viewed underage pornography, to which he replied that he had not knowingly done so.&#x201D;</em></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#xA0;</em></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Our present concern is with the people of Cornerstone to whom the Lord has entrusted us as shepherds. We have been and will continue to pursue all avenues to determine whether any of Cornerstone&#x2019;s people may have been directly or indirectly affected by any actions Dave may have taken.&#x201D;</em></div><p><!--Ads2--></p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#xA0;</em></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We are saddened that one who we trusted is accused of a crime and sin so significant and as defiling of humans as this. Yet we also remember that Dave denies any involvement in this crime and sin and, under the laws of Arkansas and the U.S., remains innocent until proven guilty.&#x201D;</em></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#xA0;</em></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We have asked all of our people to join in prayer for our congregation for any who may have been directly impacted by Dave&#x2019;s actions and for his family and Dave. &#x201C;</em></div><p>When his church asked if Reynolds was really looking at those things, he said he had not &#x201C;knowingly&#x201D; done so. Maybe the internet made him do it.</p><p>Check out this video of a lawyer explaining internet pornography law:</p>
