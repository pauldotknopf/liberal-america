Even though Ham&#x2019;s exercise in greed benefits from <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article73971147.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article73971147.html&apos;, &apos;$18 million in sales tax incentives&apos;);">$18 million in sales tax incentives</a>, which is super sketchy on its own, the world&#x2019;s most-recognizable Bible-jockey will dive into the private lives of his employees as a condition of hire.</p><p>If you want to be on the payroll at Ken Ham&#x2019;s Happy Jesus Fun Time Bible World and you are unmarried, you have to sign an affidavit pledging that you will not have sex with anyone.

Even in Williamstown, where the &#x201C;300 cubits&#x201D; recreation of Noah&#x2019;s Ark will stand tall and proud like the statues of Joseph Stalin once did, controversy is brewing as to whether or not Ham&#x2019;s undertaking should continue.</p><p>Baptist minister Bob Fox said in an <a href="http://fox13now.com/2016/06/21/state-supports-noahs-ark-theme-park-not-all-residents-on-board/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://fox13now.com/2016/06/21/state-supports-noahs-ark-theme-park-not-all-residents-on-board/&apos;, &apos;interview&apos;);">interview</a> with Fox13Now he&#x2019;s concerned about Ark Encounter&#x2019;s effect on the separation of church and state.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s kinds of laws called &#x2018;Sharia,&#x2019; where people have used legislation and the government to promote a religious faith, and I think we as Christians need to be careful that we continue to be Christian, and to be Christian in the context of the United States.&#x201D;</em></p><p>You know you may be crossing a line when a representative from the Baptist congregation begins questioning the efficacy of your religious-based project.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>Despite the criticisms, Ken Ham&#x2019;s baby is still expected to <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/noahs-ark-creationist-theme-park-in-kentucky-to-open-july-2016-founder/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/noahs-ark-creationist-theme-park-in-kentucky-to-open-july-2016-founder/&apos;, &apos;open&apos;);">open</a> on July 7, unless an act of God proves otherwise.
