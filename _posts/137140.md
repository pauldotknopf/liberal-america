<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>For my money, few members of the Republican Party have the ability to annoy and outrage me more than former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. He&#x2019;s been parlaying the meager luster he earned by being the mayor when 9/11 occurred for over a decade now, and his act is wearing thin.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I was so delighted to see CNN host Chris Cuomo take Giuliani to task for being a blatant Islamophobe when he appeared on the news network earlier this morning. Giuliani tried to assert that Mitch McConnell&#x2019;s reluctance to say the word &#x201C;gay&#x201D; when talking about the people targeted by the Orlando shooter was just the same as President Obama not using the phrase &#x201C;radical Islamic terrorism.&#x201D; Cuomo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc&apos;, &apos;told Giuliani&apos;);" target="_blank">told Giuliani</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Calling this gay and not using that word and not running away from it because of some sense of identity politics is wrong and you agree with that. Saying &#x2018;radical Islamic terror&#x2019; &#x2026; you used an analogy, let me reverse it on you. If every time the mafia made a killing or a murder, they said &#x2018;well, those Italians, well there&#x2019;s something about &#x2019;em, and the mob. There&#x2019;s something about the Giuliani and the Cuomo.&#x2019; How would you have felt? You would have been disgusted. It&#x2019;s one of the things that motivated you as a prosecutor to distinguish the mafia from the rest of the Italians. That is the same point, is it not? That you can&#x2019;t talk about all of Islam you talk about these perversions.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Boom! It is exactly the same thing, and Giuliani knows it, but he tried to say it wasn&#x2019;t the same thing at all,&#xA0;saying he uses the words &#x201C;radical Islamic Muslims,&#x201D; but when he says &#x201C;mafia&#x201D; he doesn&#x2019;t mean all Italians. Then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc&apos;, &apos;he added&apos;);" target="_blank">he added</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;They call themselves the Islamic State.&#x201D;</em></p><p>To that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc&apos;, &apos;Cuomo countered&apos;);" target="_blank">Cuomo countered</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;They do because they want the credit of owning the religion. They want that. Why would you give them what they want?&#x201D;</em></p><p>Unable to answer a direct question, Giuliani then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc&apos;, &apos;tried to blame&apos;);" target="_blank">tried to blame</a> it all on&#x2013;you guessed it&#x2013;President Obama:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The weaker you are, the harder they hit you.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Using that logic, George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani would be among the weakest people to ever hold any office in this country because the attacks of September 11, 2001 were the hardest this nation has ever been hit.</p><p>Cuomo finally shut down Giuliani by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc&apos;, &apos;telling him&apos;);" target="_blank">telling him</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I think there&#x2019;s some politics being played with this. With Donald Trump coming out and seeming to suggest that President Obama has some sympathy, some compromise personally that doesn&#x2019;t keep him from being tough. With all the troops, with taking out (Osama bin Laden), I mean, it just doesn&#x2019;t seem like the right kind of rhetoric. I don&#x2019;t think if you were running you would ever suggest anything like that about a Commander-in-Chief.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Watch the interview below:</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6jzWmtk5Puc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured Image Via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWmtk5Puc&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);" target="_blank">YouTube</a> Screengrab</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
