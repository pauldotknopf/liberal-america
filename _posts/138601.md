<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Today, I have an interesting list for you.&#xA0;<em>The Advocate&#xA0;</em>presented their list of the &#x201C;Biggest Homophobes Over The Last Fifty Years.&#x201D; I&#x2019;m presenting you a sample of this&#xA0;<a href="http://www.advocate.com/people/2016/6/21/50-biggest-homophobes-last-50-years" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.advocate.com/people/2016/6/21/50-biggest-homophobes-last-50-years&apos;, &apos;list:&apos;);" target="_blank">list:</a></p><h2>1.&#xA0;The Police</h2><p>This may seem odd to say now, but back in the &#x2019;60s and &#x2019;70s, cops were not friendly toward the LGBT community. The LAPD Chief Ed Davis opposed a Pride Parade in 1970. He said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, granting a parade permit to a group of homosexuals to parade down Hollywood Boulevard would be the same as giving a permit to march to a group of thieves and murderers.&#x201D; </em></p><h2>2.&#xA0;Ronald Reagan</h2><p>This one may be obvious, but he is worth mentioning. Republicans still love Ronald Reagan; they hold him up as the best president ever. However, he was not the most tolerant of the LGBT community. He once called gay people &#x201C;sick unfortunates.&#x201D; He <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/09/07/313235/recalling-ronald-reagans-lgbt-legacy-ahead-of-the-gop-presidential-debate/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/09/07/313235/recalling-ronald-reagans-lgbt-legacy-ahead-of-the-gop-presidential-debate/&apos;, &apos;ignored&apos;);" target="_blank">ignored</a> the AIDS/HIV crisis while it was beginning. He said that society cannot condone the gay &#x201C;lifestyle.&#x201D; His communications director Pat Buchanan said that AIDS is &#x201C;nature&#x2019;s revenge on gay men.&#x201D;</p><h2>3. Late &#x2019;90s Shock Jocks (Like Howard Stern)</h2><p>Howard Stern was shamed in 1990 with a &#x201C;Sissy Award&#x201D; from <em>The Advocate&#xA0;</em>for saying that lesbians would turn for him. Surprisingly, he&#x2019;s not the worst one. A Connecticut DJ named Sebastian had punchlines about castrating &#x201C;fags.&#x201D;</p><h2>4. Robert Mugabe</h2><p>This guy was a dictator in Zimbabwe. In 1995, he said that gay people are &#x201C;worse than pigs and dogs.&#x201D; He called gay people insane, unnatural, and his country criminalized being gay.</p><h2>5. Fred Cherry</h2><p>In the &#x2019;60s, this guy was a serial postcard-mailer who claimed that gay people&#xA0;were bringing in a &#x201C;perverted world.&#x201D; He said that they would create a society where they rule and heterosexuals are oppressed.</p><h2>6. Mel Gibson</h2><p>We all know about his <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/mel-gibson-puts-anti-semitism-behind-him-ive-done-what-i-need-to-do-9591666.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/mel-gibson-puts-anti-semitism-behind-him-ive-done-what-i-need-to-do-9591666.html&apos;, &apos;anti-Semitic rants&apos;);" target="_blank">anti-Semitic rants</a> and how anti-Semitic his&#xA0;<em>Passion of the Christ&#xA0;</em>movie was. Did you know that Gibson is a homophobe as well? In 1992 he won the &#x201C;Sissy of the Year&#x201D; award for standing up during an interview, pointing to his butt and saying, &#x201C;This is only for taking a shit.&#x201D;</p><h2>7.&#xA0;Laura Schlessinger</h2><p>This so-called &#x201C;doctor&#x201D; is the one who said that homosexuality is a &#x201C;biological error&#x201D; in 1998. The following year, she said &#xA0;&#x201C;a huge portion of the male homosexual populace is predatory on young boys.&#x201D; She tried to have a talk show, but it was quickly cancelled.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><h2>8. Fred Phelps</h2><p>This nasty man set up one of the most hateful organizations out there. The Westboro Baptist Church became famous for their &#x201C;God hates fags&#x201D; signs and protesting funerals.</p><h2>9. Marcus and Michele Bachmann</h2><p>Former Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann is particularly crazy, but her husband is way worse. She <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/03/24/shocker-republican-says-god-is-punishing-us-again/" target="_blank">said</a> that the terror attacks in Brussels were God&#x2019;s way of punishing us for President Obama&#x2019;s visit to Cuba.</p><p>Donald Trump is <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/21/breaking-trump-recruits-michele-bachmann-james-dobson-evangelical-executive-advisory-board/" target="_blank">including</a> her in his &#x201C;evangelical advisory board.&#x201D; They run a Christian counseling clinic together.&#xA0;It&#x2019;s one of the places where parents send their LGBT children to try and make them &#x201C;normal.&#x201D;</p><p>Here is a mashup of many homophobic comments from a YouTube Channel.
