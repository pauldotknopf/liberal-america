<p>Ever since the Brexit vote in Great Britain last week, Donald Trump has been saying that the results of the referendum prove he&#x2019;s on the right side of history and that it&#x2019;s a harbinger of great things to come for him in November. Trump even said that Americans&#xA0;will be able to reject &#x201C;the global elite&#x201D; in the general election.</p><p>That notion was pitched to President Obama yesterday during an interview with NPR, and the President wasted no time making Trump look even dumber than he usually does. <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/president-obama-calmly-explains-why-brexit-doesnt-mean-trump-will-win/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/president-obama-calmly-explains-why-brexit-doesnt-mean-trump-will-win/&apos;, &apos;Obama said&apos;);" target="_blank">Obama said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Mr. Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life.&#xA0;So, he&#x2019;s hardly a spokesperson, a legitimate spokesperson for a populist surge of working-class people on either side of the Atlantic.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The President <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/president-obama-calmly-explains-why-brexit-doesnt-mean-trump-will-win/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/president-obama-calmly-explains-why-brexit-doesnt-mean-trump-will-win/&apos;, &apos;also correctly noted&apos;);" target="_blank">also correctly noted</a> that there were major differences between the forces which led to Brexit and the kind of nonsense Trump is trying to incite in the United States with his continual hate speech:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The ability to tap into a fear that people may have about losing control and to offer some vague nostalgic feelings about how we&#x2019;ll make Britain great again or we&#x2019;ll make America great again, and the subtext for that is somehow that a bunch of foreigners and funny-looking people are coming in here and changing the basic character of the nation; I think that some of that is out there.&#x201D;</em></p><p>While he was on the topic of Brexit and the uncertainty it has caused in worldwide financial markets, the President <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/president-obama-calmly-explains-why-brexit-doesnt-mean-trump-will-win/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/online/president-obama-calmly-explains-why-brexit-doesnt-mean-trump-will-win/&apos;, &apos;urged calm&apos;);" target="_blank">urged calm</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I think that the best way to think about this is, a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration.&#xA0;I would not overstate it.&#xA0;There&#x2019;s been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow NATO&#x2019;s gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That&#x2019;s not what&#x2019;s happening.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Thank goodness we have a rational, focused person like President Obama guiding this country during uncertain times. It sure beats the hello out of a screaming Cheeto-faced blowhard who looks like a vermin crawled atop his head and died.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the interview President Obama gave to NPR:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BnBmOPZI_Wc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
