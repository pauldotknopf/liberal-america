<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>During his entire campaign, Donald Trump (R-N.Y.) has used silly nicknames for many of the other presidential candidates, as well as non-candidate&#xA0;politicians. &#xA0;He has gotten into Twitter <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/10/hillary-clintons-3-final-words-donald-trump-broke-twitter-tweets/" target="_blank">battles</a> with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Clinton <a href="https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/740973710593654784" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/740973710593654784&apos;, &apos;told him&apos;);">told him</a> to just &#x201C;Delete your account,&#x201D; and the internet lost their shit. It was beautiful.</p><p>Now, The Donald is doing some website battling. He has launched a website against &#x201C;Lying Crooked Hillary.&#x201D; Here is what he said about it in a <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/launching-lyingcrookedhillary.com" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/launching-lyingcrookedhillary.com&apos;, &apos;statement&apos;);">statement</a>&#xA0;to supporters:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;As we proceed forward with the general election, it is more important than ever for America to realize how dishonest Crooked Hillary really is. We can&#x2019;t trust her now and we can&#x2019;t allow her to take her dishonesty to the White House. At every stage of Clinton&#x2019;s career, she has deceived the public to enrich herself and family at the expense of Americans. Crooked Hillary has continually placed Washington D.C. special interests&#x2019; priorities over the interests of everyday Americans. Four years of Crooked Hillary in the White House is not a risk Americans can take.&#x201D;</em></p><div id="attachment_138839" style="width: 860px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-138839" src="http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488" alt="Image: Screenshot Via lyingcrookedhillary.com" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 850w, http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 64w, http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 350w, http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 768w, http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 600w, http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 190w, http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trump-crooked-hillary-Website-screenshot.jpg?resize=850%2C488 795w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1">
