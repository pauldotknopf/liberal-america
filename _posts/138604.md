But the thing that makes me </em>want<em> to tell the truth is that he didn&#x2019;t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge.</em><em>&#x201D;</em></p><p>When asked why he is speaking out, he said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> &#x201C;It&#x2019;s my responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The man wore a disguise and would only be identified as &#x201C;Miguel.&#x201D; He said that Mateen&#x2019;s attack was motivated by a sexual encounter with two Latino men.
