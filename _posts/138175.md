Witnesses say a man was trying to steal a bicycle, so this rancher just lassoed him. The thief was arrested and identified as 23-year-old Victorino Sanchez.</p><p>The talented <a href="http://twistedsifter.com/2016/06/guy-on-horse-lassoes-walmart-bike-thief/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://twistedsifter.com/2016/06/guy-on-horse-lassoes-walmart-bike-thief/&apos;, &apos;rancher&apos;);" target="_blank">rancher</a>, Robert Borba, who caught this bike thief was there with his horse, Long John, in a trailer.

It sounds like something out of an old Western movie, but it was real.</p><p>Borba said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I </em>seen<em> this fella trying to get up to speed on a bicycle. I wasn&#x2019;t going to catch him on foot. I just don&#x2019;t run very fast&#x2026;</em><em>I use a rope every day, that&#x2019;s how I make my living. If it catches cattle pretty good, it catches a bandit pretty good.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Sgt.

That&#x2019;s a first for me.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Another police officer, Chris Adams, said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;When we arrived, there was a large crowd standing around a younger gentleman who was on the ground, the rope around his ankle, hanging on to a tree.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Borba has just recently moved to town, Adams said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;it appears he will be a good fit. Eagle Point is a small city, and people watch out for each other. That&#x2019;s exactly what he did.&#x201D;</em></p><p>David Stepp was sitting in a car in the parking lot when he saw&#xA0;the incident. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/10/bike-theft-oregon-walmart-thief-lassoed-cattle-rancher" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/10/bike-theft-oregon-walmart-thief-lassoed-cattle-rancher&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I was laughing too hard to intervene.
