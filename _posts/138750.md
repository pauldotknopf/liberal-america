<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>When Donald Trump met with and pandered to members of the religious right on Tuesday, one of those he spoke to and tried to court was a man named Troy Newman. Who is Troy Newman? He&#x2019;s the head of the violent anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.</p><p>As part of his wooing process, Newman <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/takeaways-newman-among-religious-leaders-who-met-with-trump/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/takeaways-newman-among-religious-leaders-who-met-with-trump/&apos;, &apos;reported that Trump&apos;);" target="_blank">reported that Trump</a> promised at the Tuesday meeting to do the following:</p><ul>
<li class="rteindent1"><em>Appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices, which have been pre-vetted by the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.</em></li>
<li class="rteindent1"><em>&#xA0;Appoint strong pro-life judges to the Federal Courts.</em></li>
<li class="rteindent1"><em>&#xA0;Repeal and replace Obamacare and the abortion mandate that forces the insured to pay for abortions and abortifacient drugs.</em></li>
<li class="rteindent1"><em>&#xA0;Actively support and sign into law the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.</em></li>
<li class="rteindent1"><em>Defund America&#x2019;s largest supplier of abortion, Planned Parenthood.</em></li>
</ul><p>But there&#x2019;s something else that you need to know about Troy Newman: He <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/donald-trump-courts-activist-who-wants-abortion-providers-put-death" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/donald-trump-courts-activist-who-wants-abortion-providers-put-death&apos;, &apos;has said that&apos;);" target="_blank">has said that</a> anyone convicted of murdering an abortion provider is &#x201C;little more than a political prisoner&#x201D;&#xA0;who should be allowed to argue that he was performing a &#x201C;justifiable defensive action&#x201D; and &#x201C;present a defense that claimed that the killing of the abortionist was necessary to save the lives of the pre-born babies that were scheduled to be killed by abortion that day.&#x201D;</p><p>Also, Newman, along with a colleague,&#xA0;Cheryl Sullenger (who served time in prison for conspiring to bomb a family planning clinic in the 1980s), wrote&#xA0;a manifesto in which they asserted that the government has a responsibility to execute those who perform abortions. Here&#x2019;s a <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-planned-parenthood-activist-troy-newmans-terrifying-woman-shaming-apocalyptic-manifesto" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-planned-parenthood-activist-troy-newmans-terrifying-woman-shaming-apocalyptic-manifesto&apos;, &apos;portion of &apos;);" target="_blank">portion of </a>what they wrote:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;In addition to our personal guilt in abortion, the United States government has abrogated its responsibility to properly deal with the blood-guilty. This responsibility rightly involves executing convicted murderers, including abortionists, for their crimes in order to expunge bloodguilt from the land and people.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Rejecting that innocent blood is to reject the only standard that is effective against innocent bloodshed, excluding the lawful execution of the murderers, which is commanded by God in Scripture.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Newman <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-planned-parenthood-activist-troy-newmans-terrifying-woman-shaming-apocalyptic-manifesto" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/anti-planned-parenthood-activist-troy-newmans-terrifying-woman-shaming-apocalyptic-manifesto&apos;, &apos;has also stated&apos;);" target="_blank">has also stated</a> that a woman who has an abortion is a murderer and&#xA0;shouldn&#x2019;t be treated any differently than abortion providers or &#x201C;any other mother&#x201D; who killed &#x201C;any other family member.&#x201D;</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>These are the kinds of people Donald Trump is rubbing elbows with and making promises to. In other words, he is making deals with domestic terrorists who think the ends justify the means in the name of God. Remind me again how this is any different from the &#x201C;radical Islamic terror&#x201D; Trump and his ilk are so fond of saying is&#xA0;the biggest threat to the United States.</p><p><em>Featured Image Via YouTube Screengrab</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
