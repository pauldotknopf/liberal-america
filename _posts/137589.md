For President Reagan, it was a note that accompanied a scribbled message to his successor,&#xA0;George H.W. Bush, that&#xA0;simply <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/01/bush-to-obama-s.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/01/bush-to-obama-s.html&apos;, &apos;read&apos;);">read</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#x201C;<em>Don&#x2019;t let the turkeys get you down</em>.&#x201D;</p><p>Four years later, Bush continued that tradition by leaving a letter on the desk in the Oval Office for Bill Clinton. In a collection of Bush&#x2019;s other writings, the letter was mentioned, as&#xA0;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/13/the-magnanimous-bipartisan-and-dignified-letter-george-hw-bush-l/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/13/the-magnanimous-bipartisan-and-dignified-letter-george-hw-bush-l/&apos;, &apos;stating&apos;);">stating</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#x201C;<em>I leave a note on the desk for Bill Clinton. It looks a little lonely sitting there. I don&#x2019;t want it to be overly dramatic, but I did want him to know that I would be rooting for him</em>.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CameronJJJ" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/CameronJJJ&apos;, &apos;James Cameron&apos;);">James Cameron</a> recently tweeted this picture of the letter left for Bill:</p><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>This tradition has continued from Clinton&#xA0;to George W.
