As one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, Apple&#x2019;s decision carries a great deal of weight, and may impact the decisions of other companies.</p><p>Apple has made its decision based on the behavior and language of Donald Trump, who is expected to become the Republican nominee at the convention in Cleveland. &#xA0;The company spoke specifically about Trump&#x2019;s comments on&#xA0;women, immigrants and other minority groups.</p><p>A PAC called <a href="http://www.colorofchange.org/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.colorofchange.org/&apos;, &apos;ColorOfChange&apos;);">ColorOfChange</a>&#xA0;has been encouraging companies to boycott the GOP in order to make a stand against Trump&#x2019;s bigotry and hatred. Most big corporations like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/6/18/11969350/apple-trump-gop-convention" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.recode.net/2016/6/18/11969350/apple-trump-gop-convention&apos;, &apos;pledged support&apos;);">pledged support</a> for the convention, but Apple joins Hewlett-Packard in making a stand against bigotry.</p><p>ColorOfChange spokesman Rashad Robinson said:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;The Apple news raises the bar for other corporations. Not only has Apple declined to support the Republican National Convention, but they&#x2019;ve explicitly told Republican leaders that Trump&#x2019;s bigoted rhetoric is the reason that they&#x2019;re sitting out.&#xA0;This is what real corporate responsibility looks like.&#x201D;</span></em></p><p class="p1">This is not the first time that Apple Computer has run into a conflict with Donald Trump. Last February when the FBI was struggling to unlock the iPhone of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/san-bernardino-shooting" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/specials/san-bernardino-shooting&apos;, &apos;San Bernardino killer&apos;);">San Bernardino killer</a>, Apple refused to provide inside information to help them. Trump immediately called for a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-apple_us_56c78150e4b0928f5a6bdd3e" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-apple_us_56c78150e4b0928f5a6bdd3e&apos;, &apos;boycott&apos;);">boycott</a> of all Apple products in protest.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boycott all Apple products  until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal</p>

The spokeswoman for the Cleveland 2016 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-republican-national-convention_us_5765a446e4b0853f8bf11eaa?dfkiwtfdjtjglow29" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-republican-national-convention_us_5765a446e4b0853f8bf11eaa?dfkiwtfdjtjglow29&apos;, &apos;Host Committee claims&apos;);">Host Committee claims</a> that they have already raised nearly all of the money they need, and won&#x2019;t be hurt by Apple&#x2019;s action.</p><p class="p1">While the respective parties raise a great deal of the money for their increasingly expensive conventions, non-profit host committees are also raising funds. The non-profits can accept direct cash donations from corporations, which the party-run groups are not allowed to do.</p><p class="p1">Its unclear how much of an impact Apple&#x2019;s boycott of the Republican convention will do, but I know that I intend to get myself a new iPhone as soon as humanly possible.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/D59oezEyeQI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p class="p1">Featured image via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Campus" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Campus&apos;, &apos;Wikipedia&apos;);">Wikipedia</a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
