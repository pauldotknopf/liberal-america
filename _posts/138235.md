<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Florida Assistant State Attorney Kenneth Lewis has been suspended for being an idiotic, hateful bigot on Facebook. When will these people learn that everyone can see their disgusting rants? He served in the 9th Judicial District, which includes Orlando.</p><div id="attachment_138257" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-138257" src="//i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ken_lewis.png?resize=640%2C359" alt="state attorney" data-recalc-dims="1">

The entire city should be leveled, it is a melting pot of 3rd world miscreants and ghetto thugs. It is void of culture.&#xA0;If you live down there you do it at your own risk and at your own peril. If you go down there after dark there is seriously something wrong with you.&#x201D;</em></p><p>He also <a href="http://knightnews.com/2016/06/prosecutor-ken-lewis-suspended-over-offensive-orlando-facebook-posts/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://knightnews.com/2016/06/prosecutor-ken-lewis-suspended-over-offensive-orlando-facebook-posts/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a> this about Disney World:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Disney does everything in its power to shield visitors of Disney from its northern blight. That doesn&#x2019;t change reality. Disney may be the happiest place on earth but Orlando is a national embarrassment. If this is an act of domestic terrorist it is so important that we don&#x2019;t publish the religion, name, or motive of the terrorist as not to offend anyone.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Lewis has been suspended because he violated the social media policy that he signed in 2015. The policy was changed in part because of another Facebook faux pas he committed on Mother&#x2019;s Day in 2014.</p><p>He <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/florida-official-kenneth-lewis-suspended-over-anti-orlando-facebook-post-n594966" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/florida-official-kenneth-lewis-suspended-over-anti-orlando-facebook-post-n594966&apos;, &apos;posted&apos;);">posted</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Happy Mother&#x2019;s Day to all the crack hoes out there.

Does that mean his friends like these posts?
