Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) may have <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/03/ted-cruz-suspends-campaign/">lost</a> the presidential nomination this year, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that conservative&#xA0;leaders have given up hope for him as the leader of the free world.</p><p>In the shadow of Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for 2016, 20 key leaders met in <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283655-top-conservatives-meet-at-secret-dinner-to-discuss-cruzs" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283655-top-conservatives-meet-at-secret-dinner-to-discuss-cruzs&apos;, &apos;secret&apos;);">secret</a> to discuss what is next for Ted Cruz.</p><p><!--Ads1--><br>
According to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283655-top-conservatives-meet-at-secret-dinner-to-discuss-cruzs" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283655-top-conservatives-meet-at-secret-dinner-to-discuss-cruzs&apos;, &apos;The Hill&apos;);">The Hill</a>, no one would speak on the record about what was discussed, but sources say the leaders met to discuss&#xA0;how to position Cruz for the 2020 nomination. Those same sources say that&#xA0;NRA&#xA0;board member Ken Blackwell, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, Heritage Foundation leader&#xA0;Jim DeMint, and Club for Growth President David McIntosh were among those in attendance.</p><p>Comparisons to Reagan and his failed 1976 and successful 1980 run were the theme for the night.</p><p>The super secret dinner was held at the home of activist Brent Bozell &#xA0;who would not confirm details of conversations but did share at least this much.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There was just discussion of the future of the movement and the future of Ted Cruz as the leader of the movement,&#x201D; Bozell told The Hill.&#xA0;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There are a lot of similarities with Reagan in &#x2019;76, where Reagan came very close and then in &#x2019;80 won the presidency,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;</em></p><p>There is tremendous dislike of Cruz within the GOP, but he remains a favorite among conservatives. Something McIntosh was also willing to discuss with a reporter from The Hill.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I think [Cruz] earned the position of being the leader of the conservative movement in terms of an elected official,&#x201D; McIntosh told The Hill&#xA0;on Wednesday.&#xA0;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Talking to him &#x2026; I think he&#x2019;s thinking about how to do that and ready to step into that leadership role,&#x201D; he added, saying he wouldn&#x2019;t get into private conversations had at the dinner.&#xA0;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a huge Ronald Reagan fan so the analogy I used with Ted is, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re Ronald Reagan in 1977 and you&#x2019;ve got a choice: Are you going to take on the leadership of the movement?&#x2019; &#x201D;&#xA0;</em></p>
