The funding bill was approved with a vote of 239-171.</p><p>The bill would provide $622 million to combat the dangerous mosquito born virus. While that sounds like a significant amount of money, it is only about <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280459-house-approves-zika-funding-bill-over-white-house-veto-threat" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280459-house-approves-zika-funding-bill-over-white-house-veto-threat&apos;, &apos;one-third&apos;);">one-third</a> of what had been requested by the White House&#xA0;and&#xA0;about one-half of what had been requested by the Senate.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Politics prevailed over public health:  The House passes a rider-laden, inadequate, funding-cut filled <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zika?src=hash" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zika?src=hash&apos;, &apos;#Zika&apos;);">#Zika</a> bill. <a href="https://t.co/hUwZ6LWIU5" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/hUwZ6LWIU5&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/hUwZ6LWIU5&apos;);">https://t.co/hUwZ6LWIU5</a></p>

Representative Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280459-house-approves-zika-funding-bill-over-white-house-veto-threat" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280459-house-approves-zika-funding-bill-over-white-house-veto-threat&apos;, &apos;stated&apos;);">stated</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;When a tornado strikes, we don&#x2019;t steal money from the unfinished relief efforts for the last hurricane. Yet House Republicans would take more Ebola funding, risking that it could re-emerge.&#x201D;</em></p><p>One of the key&#xA0;issues&#xA0;on Zika funding is the timeline. The Senate bill extended the funding through September 2017, but the House version would&#xA0;last only 6 months. That would obviously mean that either Zika eradication efforts would stop, or the Congress would be right back to fighting over the&#xA0;desperately needed money to continue it.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>The White House reacted very strongly to the House bill. Press Secretary Josh Earnest&#xA0;<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280459-house-approves-zika-funding-bill-over-white-house-veto-threat" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280459-house-approves-zika-funding-bill-over-white-house-veto-threat&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x2018;The only thing that Republicans in the House have come forward with is funding at like a third of the level that our public health experts recommend. That doesn&#x2019;t make sense at all. That is a dumb approach. And I don&#x2019;t really understand why&#x2014;&#xA0;why one would even consider an approach like that.&#x201D;</span></em></p><p>Given the bitter nature of the debates in Congress, and the inability of anyone there to compromise, it seems to me that having to reopen&#xA0;the debate in the fall is a very bad idea.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KTYgOd5Yo_c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><em>Featured image via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlITO61h-L0" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlITO61h-L0&apos;, &apos;YouTube&apos;);">YouTube</a> screengrab.</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
