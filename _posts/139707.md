<p>Say hello to &#x201C;Babypod.&#x201D; This small device is a speaker that can be put inside of a pregnant woman to play music for the baby. This is a bit ridiculous, just put your headphones on your stomach like a normal pregnant mom.</p><p>This device was developed after the <a href="http://institutomarques.com/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://institutomarques.com/&apos;, &apos;Institute Marques&apos;);" target="_blank">Institute Marques</a>&#xA0;did a study on music at the beginning of life. From the Babypod&#xA0;<a href="https://www.babypod.net/en/babypod/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.babypod.net/en/babypod/&apos;, &apos;website&apos;);" target="_blank">website</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Music has many benefits for the human brain, including acting as a stimulus for learning and it plays an important role in the sphere of social communication. Stimulating babies through music in their first months of life has positive effects on brain development; if this is so, why not give your baby the benefits of music starting before birth?&#x201D;</em></p><p>Because of its placement, Babypod can supposedly deliver better sound to babies <a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/meet-babypod-an-intravaginal-speaker-that-delivers-music-to-your-fetus/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/meet-babypod-an-intravaginal-speaker-that-delivers-music-to-your-fetus/&apos;, &apos;because&apos;);" target="_blank">because</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The uterus is a place protected from the exterior, and it is the mother&#x2019;s body that carries out this protecting role through multiple layers of soft tissue.&#xA0;These attenuate the intensity of sound and distort it in its journey to the uterus; it&#x2019;s similar to what happens when you hear a conversation in the next-door room without catching everything that is said.&#x201D;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;By placing a speaker inside the vagina, we overcome the barrier formed by the abdominal wall and the baby can hear sounds with almost as much intensity and clarity as when emitted.&#x201D;</em></p><p>You may be wondering, how do you use this. The steps according to the website <a href="https://www.babypod.net/en/how-to-use-babypod/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.babypod.net/en/how-to-use-babypod/&apos;, &apos;are&apos;);" target="_blank">are</a>:</p><ol>
<li>Gently insert the free end of Babypod until it is inside the vagina.</li>
