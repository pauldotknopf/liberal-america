<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>A little-noticed tidbit in Donald Trump&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/21/trump-campaign-nearly-broke-getting-crushed-clinton-machine/">epically anemic</a> financial disclosures for May could tell us a lot about his campaign. His web advertising firm appears to be <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/06/21/3790715/weird-story-behind-trump-campaigns-35000-payment-draper-sterling-advertising/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/06/21/3790715/weird-story-behind-trump-campaigns-35000-payment-draper-sterling-advertising/&apos;, &apos;an obscure company&apos;);">an obscure company</a>&#xA0;with a joke name run out of a house in New Hampshire, and may have helped a super PAC break the law.</p><p>Think Progress&#x2019; Judd Legum noticed that on May 27, the Trump campaign paid $35,000 to a New Hampshire-based firm called Draper Sterling LLC for &#x201C;web advertising.&#x201D; That immediately raised a red flag, since Draper and Sterling are the lead characters in the hit AMC series &#x201C;Mad Men.&#x201D; He got even more suspicious when he searched for the address in Londonderry, New Hampshire. This is what turned up.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the address listed for &quot;Draper Sterling,&quot; the entity Trump paid $35,000 in May for advertising <a href="https://t.co/TnDDf0OPyY" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/TnDDf0OPyY&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/TnDDf0OPyY&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/TnDDf0OPyY</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/745096813821177856" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/745096813821177856&apos;, &apos;June 21, 2016&apos;);">June 21, 2016</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Not exactly where you&#x2019;d expect a major-party presidential campaign to turn for crafting web ads.</p><p>But it turns out that Draper Sterling is actually a real company. It was founded in&#xA0;March&#xA0;by Jon Adkins, who apparently runs the company out of his house in Londonderry. However, according to Huffington Post, many New Hampshire Republicans haven&#x2019;t even heard of him. Apparently Trump liked him enough to pay him $3,000 for &#x201C;field consulting.&#x201D;</p><p>Now here&#x2019;s where things really get interesting. Adkins&#x2019; day job is serving as president of <a href="http://xenotherapeutics.org/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://xenotherapeutics.org/&apos;, &apos;XenoTherapeutics&apos;);">XenoTherapeutics</a>, a Boston-based biotech&#xA0;startup that he founded with Republican operative Paul Holzer, who also got $3,000 from Trump for &#x201C;field consulting.&#x201D; However, it appears that XenoTherapeutics is based out of an apartment in Boston. Even more telling is that Holzer lists Adkins&#x2019; Londonderry house as his home address. According to a neighbor, however, it doesn&#x2019;t look like Holzer actually lives there.</p><p>It turns out that Draper Sterling is under the microscope for some potentially illegal financial activity in Missouri. Last month, Aaron Hedlund, an economics professor at the University of Missouri, filed a complaint with the FEC against Patriots for America, a super PAC involved in the Missouri gubernatorial race. Hedlund claims that Patriots for America claims no receipts or disbursements in its FEC filings, but has over $56,000 in debt to Draper Sterling for &#x201C;business consulting.&#x201D; In a colossal understatement, Hedlund thinks it&#x2019;s &#x201C;highly unusual&#x201D; at best that a PAC that supposedly has no money would need to spend any money on &#x201C;business consulting.&#x201D;</p><p>Patriots for America is helmed by Adam McLain, who is Paul Holzer&#x2019;s brother. The number listed for Patriots for America is the same as the number for a cafe in Grantham, New Hampshire owned by Atkins. When Legum called the cafe, McLain answered with a blizzard of &#x201C;no comments.&#x201D; Holzer told Fortune that he works for Draper Sterling <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/06/21/trump-mad-men/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://fortune.com/2016/06/21/trump-mad-men/&apos;, &apos;on the side&apos;);">on the side</a>&#x2013;but can&#x2019;t elaborate on it, per a nondisclosure agreement. When Think Progress and HuffPo started digging into this tangled web, XenoTherapeutics&#x2019; Website briefly went offline, but is back online as of Tuesday night.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>So Trump, who is supposedly a billionaire, is so cheap that he not only has a paltry $1.3 million on hand, but is relying on a two-person firm run out of a house to build his web advertising campaign. And said firm is caught in a web of shady deals, and may have also broken federal campaign finance law. The closest parallel I can draw is to Bernie Madoff using a two-person firm in rural New York to audit his books. Fitting, since like Madoff, Trump is trying to swindle his way to power.</p><p><em>(<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/80038275@N00/20724485306" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.flickr.com/photos/80038275@N00/20724485306&apos;, &apos;Featured image&apos;);">Featured image</a> courtesy Michael Vadon, available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&apos;, &apos;Creative Commons BY-SA&apos;);">Creative Commons BY-SA</a> license)</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
