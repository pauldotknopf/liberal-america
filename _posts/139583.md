<p>A right-wing nutjob in Australia, Cory Bernardi, thinks that children taking sex-education classes will learn how to buy sex toys and visit bondage clubs.</p><p>A Melbourne mother, Pia Cerveri, wrote Bernardi an email complaining about his stance and was very surprised to get this real <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/22/politician-claims-kids-will-learn-how-to-find-bondage-clubs-in-sex-ed-lessons/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/22/politician-claims-kids-will-learn-how-to-find-bondage-clubs-in-sex-ed-lessons/&apos;, &apos;reply&apos;);" target="_blank">reply</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You clearly haven&#x2019;t got any idea what is in the program.&#xA0;</em><em>If you did then you would be worried about your children being exposed to unhealthy ideas from such an early age.&#xA0;</em><em>Give it a go and get your five-year-old a book called The Gender Fairy and let him experiment with being a girl.&#xA0;</em><em>Then when he is 15 he can just use the girls change room (sic) whilst using the links provided on the information website to find more about bondage clubs and adult sex toys.&#xA0;</em><em>This is what the safe schools materials encourage. If you think this is ok then I worry for your children. Inform yourself properly and then get back to me.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Cerveri&#xA0;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/03/22/safe-schools-cory-bernardi_n_9520144.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/03/22/safe-schools-cory-bernardi_n_9520144.html&apos;, &apos;told&apos;);" target="_blank">told</a> the Huffington Post:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect him to reply. I&#x2019;ve written to politicians before, usually they takes </em>age<em> to reply and it&#x2019;s usually a form reply with their signature. I&#x2019;ve never experienced something like that. I was quite surprised. I couldn&#x2019;t quite compute what he had written</em><em>.&#x201D;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I found his tone quite aggressive, very arrogant and dismissive of other opinions. I was really shocked. He&#x2019;s an elected official, holds public office, he&#x2019;s a leader. The tone of the email is insulting.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This Senator obviously doesn&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on in sex education classrooms. I don&#x2019;t know&#xA0;what they are like in Australia, but the ones here can be pretty bad. We have the horrid abstinence-only sex education programs.</p><p>They teach that abstinence until marriage is the only option. They also lie and say that condoms and birth control don&#x2019;t work. We need to get accurate sex education programs for all students.</p><p>Here is John Oliver&#x2019;s amazing segment on sex education:</p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L0jQz6jqQS0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
