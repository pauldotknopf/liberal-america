<p>The Hillary Clinton smear-job book by former Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne has been slammed by his peers as both <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/27/the-secret-service-officer-out-to-get-hillary-clinton.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/27/the-secret-service-officer-out-to-get-hillary-clinton.html&apos;, &apos;untruthful and unethical&apos;);" target="_blank">untruthful and unethical</a>, but there&#x2019;s nothing not to love about it if you&#x2019;re Sean Hannity.</p><p>As part of his <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/sean_hannity_s_hilarious_proof_of_hillary_clinton_s_anger_062716" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.newshounds.us/sean_hannity_s_hilarious_proof_of_hillary_clinton_s_anger_062716&apos;, &apos;hour-long fawning&apos;);" target="_blank">hour-long fawning</a> over Byrne Monday night (that also included <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/sean_hannity_invents_a_new_way_to_blame_vince_foster_s_death_on_hillary_clinton_062816" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.newshounds.us/sean_hannity_invents_a_new_way_to_blame_vince_foster_s_death_on_hillary_clinton_062816&apos;, &apos;a new way&apos;);" target="_blank">a new way</a> to blame Clinton for Vince Foster&#x2019;s suicide), Hannity helped promote the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-bill-clinton-secret-service-224578" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-bill-clinton-secret-service-224578&apos;, &apos;questioned and questionable&apos;);" target="_blank">questioned and questionable</a> story that Hillary repeatedly assaulted Bill.</p><p>In the video below, Hannity urges Byrne to elaborate on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/27/former-secret-service-officer-calls-hillary-clinton-dictator-details-bill/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/27/former-secret-service-officer-calls-hillary-clinton-dictator-details-bill/&apos;, &apos;a previous anecdote&apos;);" target="_blank">a previous anecdote</a> about a &#x201C;horrendous fight&#x201D; between the Clintons that included a broken vase on the floor.</p><p>From the Fox News&#xA0;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/27/former-secret-service-officer-calls-hillary-clinton-dictator-details-bill/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/27/former-secret-service-officer-calls-hillary-clinton-dictator-details-bill/&apos;, &apos;transcript&apos;);" target="_blank">transcript</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;HANNITY: You didn&#x2019;t finish the story about the vase because that morning, he came down after that vase was broken, and he had a black eye that&#x2014;like a big black eye.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>BYRNE: Sure. Sure. So after the incident when he came&#x2014;the next time I saw him in the Oval Office, he had a mark under his eye. You could see they were trying to hide it with makeup.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[&#x2026;]</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>HANNITY: The Secret Service had to decide whether or not&#x2026;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>BYRNE: Right. Right.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>HANNITY: &#x2026; his own wife was a physical threat to the president.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>BYRNE: Right.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>HANNITY: How big of an issue was that?</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>BYRNE: It was a concern. I&#x2019;ve discussed it with other officers at the time, and agents. What do you do about a domestic dispute?

One big reason is that Byrne has been denounced by his own former colleagues.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-bill-clinton-secret-service-224578" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-bill-clinton-secret-service-224578&apos;, &apos;Politico&apos;);" target="_blank">Politico</a>, the president of the Association of Former Agents of the United States Secret Service, which rarely issues any public statements, issued one that blasts Byrne. Furthermore, Politico reports:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The book has rankled current and former members of the Secret Service, who don&#x2019;t like anyone airing their business in public &#x2014; but who also take issue with Byrne inflating his role. Byrne was a uniformed officer in Bill Clinton&#x2019;s White House. But that&#x2019;s the lowest level of protection within the White House and around the president.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>People familiar with West Wing security laugh at the idea that Byrne or any uniformed officer ever would have walked in on Bill Clinton anywhere, whether in a meeting or, as a New York Post <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/06/18/monica-lewinsky-ironically-freaked-out-that-bill-cheated-on-her/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://nypost.com/2016/06/18/monica-lewinsky-ironically-freaked-out-that-bill-cheated-on-her/&apos;, &apos;article&apos;);" target="_blank">article</a> over the weekend claims, in the middle of a make-out session in the Map Room with the late daughter of former Vice President Walter Mondale. The Secret Service presidential detail would have stopped him. (That affair was a well-worn rumor during the Clinton years, though strongly denied by Eleanor Mondale, who died of brain cancer in 2011.)&#x201D;</em></p><p>But, of course, Hannity never challenged a word Byrne said.</p><p>Watch it below from the June 27 Hannity show.</p><p>(H/T <a href="http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/06/28/fox-news-attacks-hillary-accuses-her-of-beating-up-bill-in-white-house-video/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/06/28/fox-news-attacks-hillary-accuses-her-of-beating-up-bill-in-white-house-video/&apos;, &apos;New Century Times&apos;);" target="_blank">New Century Times</a>)</p>
