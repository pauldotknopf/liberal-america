Hastert was a strong supporter of President George W. Bush&#x2019;s controversial foreign and domestic policies. In 2004, Hastert instituted what has become known as the Hastert rule, or &#x201C;majority of the majority&#x201D; rule, wherein the House of Representatives were only allowed to vote on bills that were supported by the majority of its Republican members.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>It&#x2019;s no wonder Hastert resigned his seat when the Democrats took control of the House following the 2006 mid-term elections.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NjdexPHzi9w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bistrosavage/66726697" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.flickr.com/photos/bistrosavage/66726697&apos;, &apos;Doug Bowman&apos;);">Doug Bowman</a>, available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&apos;, &apos;Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic&apos;);">Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic</a> license.</em></p><p><em>h/t <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/former-house-speaker-dennis-hastert-to-report-to-prison?utm_content=buffer7053c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/former-house-speaker-dennis-hastert-to-report-to-prison?utm_content=buffer7053c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&apos;, &apos;Talking Points Memo&apos;);">Talking Points Memo</a></em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
