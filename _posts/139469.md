<p>A pregnant teenager in Independence, Missouri, was <a href="http://www.ksla.com/story/32318535/pregnant-teen-beaten-by-customer-over-straws-while-working-at-wendys" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.ksla.com/story/32318535/pregnant-teen-beaten-by-customer-over-straws-while-working-at-wendys&apos;, &apos;beaten&apos;);" target="_blank">beaten</a> while at work in a local Wendy&#x2019;s on Sunday. The conflict was over&#xA0;the issue of drinking straws.</p><p>Tori Repine, 19-years-old, is three months pregnant. Her face is covered in cuts and bruises, but her baby is doing fine.</p><p>Witnesses say that a purple Dodge Charger pulled up to the window. An argument ensued over drinking straws. The customer said that she didn&#x2019;t get any straws and Repine said that the straws were in the bag.</p><p>A witness told police that two African-American women pulled Repine through the window. Two more people got out of the back of the car, and joined in on the assault.</p><p>Repine&#x2019;s mother, Heather Salcedo, <a href="http://www.ksla.com/story/32318535/pregnant-teen-beaten-by-customer-over-straws-while-working-at-wendys" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.ksla.com/story/32318535/pregnant-teen-beaten-by-customer-over-straws-while-working-at-wendys&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;If you would do something like this over straws and ketchup, I&#x2019;d hate to see what you would do to somebody if you were really upset.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Repine has been released from the hospital, and while there found out that she is expecting a boy.</p><p>Salcedo also <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2016/06/27/attackers-pull-independence-wendys-worker-through-drive-thru-window-beat-up-pregnant-woman/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://fox4kc.com/2016/06/27/attackers-pull-independence-wendys-worker-through-drive-thru-window-beat-up-pregnant-woman/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;As soon as she fell on the ground, they started kicking her and punching her, and there was a third person in the back, that was a male, and he came around and started punching and kicking her as well. It was horrible, no parent should ever get a call like that&#x2026; Ever.&#x201D;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;When they were pulling my daughter out of the window, one of her co-workers came up and she let them know &#x2013; what are you guys doing? This is ridiculous, she`s [sic] pregnant. And one of the attackers said we don`t care. That tells me that they didn`t [sic] care about my daughter`s [sic]&#xA0;</em>life,<em> or my unborn grandchild`s [sic] life.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This is absolutely insane. I&#x2019;m almost speechless.&#xA0;These people assaulted another person over drinking straws. They were $0.50 straws. These people need to be in jail; they definitely don&#x2019;t need to be in public unsupervised.</p><p>Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/bIDZAon0pNk" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://youtu.be/bIDZAon0pNk&apos;, &apos;this video&apos;);">this video</a> for more information about the assault:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bIDZAon0pNk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
