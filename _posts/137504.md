When states that should be a lock are suddenly up for grabs and trending to your opponent.</p><p>Such is the case with <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds&apos;, &apos;three states&apos;);" target="_blank">three states</a> Donald Trump and the GOP should have in the bag: Arizona, Georgia, and Utah. Here&#x2019;s a look at these states and what the future holds if they continue to move toward the Democrats:</p><h3><strong>Arizona</strong></h3><p>The reason <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds&apos;, &apos;Arizona is in play&apos;);" target="_blank">Arizona is in play</a> lies in its large Hispanic population, which will more than likely go in big numbers for Clinton. Considering the highly offensive things Trump has said about Latinos and his continued talk of building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, this should be no surprise to anyone.</p><p>Trump&#x2019;s favorability numbers with Hispanics are incredibly and historically low for a Republican:&#xA0;89 percent view him unfavorably in an ABC News/Washington Post poll which was released on Wednesday. Voter registration among Hispanics is up sharply across the country, and that could be the deciding factor in Arizona and several other states.</p><h3><strong>Georgia</strong></h3><p>The last time a Democratic Presidential candidate won the Peach State was 1992, and his last name was also Clinton. The former Secretary of State may be able to duplicate that feat this November.</p><p>All <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds&apos;, &apos;four of the recent&apos;);" target="_blank">four of the recent</a> major polls from May have Trump leading by a single-digit margin in Georgia; the largest at 9 points and the smallest at a mere 1 point.</p><p>The key demographic in Clinton&#x2019;s favor is that she fares much better with the state&#x2019;s black population. To pull this&#xA0;upset would rely heavily on boosting minority turnout while also steering&#xA0;moderate voters away from Trump.</p><p>At this point, it would seem that Clinton has a definite shot at turning Georgia blue for the first time in 14 years.</p><h3><strong>Utah</strong></h3><p>Mitt Romney has already declared that he will never vote for Trump. Keep in mind that Utah has voted Republican in last 12 Presidential elections. This is among the reddest states in the country.</p><p>Clinton and Trump are <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/283660-5-unexpected-states-that-could-be-battlegrounds&apos;, &apos;tied in a new poll&apos;);" target="_blank">tied in a new poll</a>. Both garner 35 percent, with Libertarian presidential candidate <span class="rollover-people">Gary Johnson</span>&#xA0;the choice of&#xA0;13 percent of those surveyed.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what makes Utah a toss-up state:&#xA0;the Mormon vote. Mormons had one of their own&#x2013;Mitt Romney&#x2013;leading the&#xA0;GOP ticket in 2012, but large numbers are expressing doubts and concerns about Trump.</p><p>These three states have a combined total of 33 electoral votes. Should they go into the Democratic column on election night, you&#x2019;ll know a Clinton rout is in the offing. At this point, she could well be looking at winning 350 electoral votes. All she needs is the magical 270 and the White House is hers.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Stay tuned.
