<p>Earlier this month, we dealt with one of the worst <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/12/president-obama-orlando-massacre-act-terror-hate/" target="_blank">mass shootings</a> in history. Although the attacker, Omar Mateen, yelled out that he was loyal to ISIS, we are not sure that it wasn&#x2019;t <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/22/watch-omar-mateens-lover-speak-motivation-behind-orlando-attack/" target="_blank">motivated</a> by homophobia. His lover spoke out saying that Omar Mateen had an HIV scare which made him angry toward gay people.</p><p>The anti-Islamic hate is everywhere, unfortunately. A halal butcher <a href="http://usuncut.com/world/muslim-butcher-store-petrol-bomb/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://usuncut.com/world/muslim-butcher-store-petrol-bomb/&apos;, &apos;shop&apos;);" target="_blank">shop</a>, Kashmir Meat &amp; Poultry, in the United Kingdom (U.K.) was attacked by a &#x201C;petrol bomb.&#x201D;</p><p>The manager, Bashir Hussain, who was in the store during the attack, was not injured. However, most of the store was destroyed by the flames.</p><p>He was <a href="http://www.carbonated.tv/news/halal-meat-shop-west-midland-england-petrol-bomb-vandalism" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.carbonated.tv/news/halal-meat-shop-west-midland-england-petrol-bomb-vandalism&apos;, &apos;bruised&apos;);" target="_blank">bruised</a> when the Molotov cocktail hit him, but he didn&#x2019;t have any other injuries. Here is a shot of the inside of the store taken by a witness:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Racism must be stopped! &#x201C;Burned Kashmir Meat &amp; Poultry shop in Walsall,after it was firebombed on Monday night&#x201D; <a href="https://t.co/vJEOZtExci" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/vJEOZtExci&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/vJEOZtExci&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/vJEOZtExci</a></p>
