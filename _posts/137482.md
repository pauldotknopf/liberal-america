Just like the killer in Orlando, the man was drawn to a crowd of openly gay citizens.</p><p>While the Orlando killer targeted a gay nightclub, the Jerusalem killer went to a gay pride parade.</p><p>Both men had&#xA0;a deep hatred against gays and lesbians. Both wanted to kill as many people as they could in as short a time as possible. Both succeeded in killing, and both were stopped by the police.</p><p>The difference?</p><p>In Orlando, the killer was able to shoot one hundred&#xA0;people easily, killing forty nine of them. He was able to hold hostages and keep heavily armed police at bay for three-hours.</p><p>In Israel there is no broadly interpreted right to own or carry a gun. The killer there was armed with a knife. He was able to murder&#xA0;one young woman before police stopped him.</p><p>Forty-nine to one. Stricter gun laws do&#xA0;save lives.</p><p>Australia can also show how better gun laws help to save lives.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What can the U.S. learn from Australia&#x2019;s gun laws? <a href="https://t.co/OzzRu2Vy1l" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/OzzRu2Vy1l&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/OzzRu2Vy1l&apos;);">https://t.co/OzzRu2Vy1l</a> <a href="https://t.co/KpMQBnQy7D" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/KpMQBnQy7D&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/KpMQBnQy7D&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/KpMQBnQy7D</a></p>

All that&#x2019;s needed is a valid driver&#x2019;s license, a signed form swearing that the buyer is not addicted to drugs, and the lack of a felony record.</p><p>An automated background check is run within a few minutes, and the buyer can walk out the door with a deadly&#xA0;weapon.</p><p>The Huffington Post was able to get a military style&#xA0;gun&#xA0;in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-orlando_us_576059f3e4b0e4fe5143fd4d" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-orlando_us_576059f3e4b0e4fe5143fd4d&apos;, &apos;less than forty minutes&apos;);">less than forty minutes</a>.</p><p>In Israel, there is no perceived right to own a gun. If a person is of age (over 21 if they have served in the military, over 27 if they have not), has lived in Israel for at least three years, and can prove a need for a gun, then it&#x2019;s possible to earn the right to own one.</p><p>Proving the need is difficult though. Unlike the United States, you can&#x2019;t just say that someday a bad guy might break into your house. You have to prove that you work in a war zone, for example.</p><p>A prospective gun owner in Israel still has to pass a training test as well as a mental health screening in order to actually be given the weapon. Even then, the government strictly limits the amount of ammunition that a person can buy.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>When asked if a civilian in Israel might ever be given legal access to the type of semi-automatic weapon that was used in Orlando (and many other mass shootings in the U.S.) Israeli author Daniel Gordis <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-israel-guns_us_575f0721e4b0e4fe5143407a" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-israel-guns_us_575f0721e4b0e4fe5143407a&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;Never, never, never, never, never, never, zero.
