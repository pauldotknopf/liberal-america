Our awesome President Obama has had to take a lot of criticism during his terms. We are all wondering what he will do when he leaves office in January.</p><p>The Obamas&#xA0;have bought a house in Washington, D.C. so they can stay there while Sasha finishes school. Of course, the right-wingers had to dog where his house is. They got their panties in a bunch because his <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/26/rwnj-media-tizzy-president-obamas-new-house-near-mosque/" target="_blank">house</a> happens to be near a mosque.</p><p>His plans are not solidified at the moment, but he has some great ideas about what he wants to do when his term ends.</p><p>In an interview with Bloomberg, Obama <a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/06/23/president-obama-just-revealed-his-new-career-and-it-could-be-awesome/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/06/23/president-obama-just-revealed-his-new-career-and-it-could-be-awesome/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ve said this before and, I think, surprised a lot of people, but if I think about what would stir my passions had I not gone into politics, it&#x2019;d probably be starting some kind of business. The skill set of starting my presidential campaigns&#x2014;and building the kinds of teams that we did and marketing ideas&#x2014;I think would be the same kinds of skills that I would enjoy exercising in the private sector.&#x201D;</em></p><p>He was very careful not to repeat the &#x201C;a businessman could be president&#x201D; talking point that the GOP has been making:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Now, I&#x2019;m always careful about drawing too many easy parallels there, because sometimes there are CEOs who come in and start explaining to me how I should be running the presidency. And I sometimes have to stop them and say, &#x2018;All right. One, I appreciate your advice. But imagine a situation in which half your board and management were actively trying to get rid of you and prevent you from accomplishing anything. And you had 2 million employees, and you couldn&#x2019;t fire a large portion of them. And your competitors weren&#x2019;t simply promoting their own products, but were continually saying how your products were the worst that were ever invented and will cause a civilizational crisis. If you pull that all together, then you&#x2019;ve got about half of what I&#x2019;m dealing with on a daily basis.&#x2019;&#x201D;</em></p><p>Obama <a href="http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/06/23/president-obamas-next-career-move-is-bound-to-drive-republicans-nuts/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/06/23/president-obamas-next-career-move-is-bound-to-drive-republicans-nuts/&apos;, &apos;wants&apos;);" target="_blank">wants</a> to be a venture capitalist:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Well, you know, it&#x2019;s hard to say. But what I will say is that&#x2014;just to bring things full circle about innovation&#x2014;the conversations I have with Silicon Valley and with venture capital pull together my interests in science and organization in a way I find really satisfying.&#x201D;</em></p><p>After two great terms as president of our country, Obama wants to do humanitarian work. This is what makes him such a good man, and this is why we&#x2019;ll miss him so very much when he&#x2019;s gone.</p><p>To see President Obama discuss his plans for life after the presidency, see the video below:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/j6gOKSVpqDQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><!--Ads2--></p>
