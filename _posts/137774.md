In a great move, the United States Postal Service (USPS)&#xA0;<a href="https://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2016/pr16_049.htm" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2016/pr16_049.htm&apos;, &apos;unveiled&apos;);" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a stamp celebrating two important Islamic festivals. There was a ceremony held for it at the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan.</p><p>Someone <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/happy-ramadan-postal-worker-threatens-to-destroy-mail-featuring-muslim-holiday-stamps/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/happy-ramadan-postal-worker-threatens-to-destroy-mail-featuring-muslim-holiday-stamps/&apos;, &apos;identifying&apos;);" target="_blank">identifying</a> as Catherine An Ray, shared a post from anti-Islam activist Pamela Gellar. Ray added this to the post:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;[As] A US Mail Carrier I can personally assure everyone here that anything with this stamp on it will be lost or destroyed in the system before is [sic] makes </em>delivery<em>. Guaranteed. Happy Ramadan.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!--Ads1--><br>
A spokesperson for the USPS, Toni DeLancey, said this about the post:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;At this </em>time<em> we cannot confirm if the person involved in this matter is a postal employee. But we can assure you that the incident is being fully investigated and that the Postal Service will take whatever action is appropriate.&#x201D;</em></p><p>I scrolled through her profile full of hate, so you won&#x2019;t have to. This is the idiotic post in all of its glory:</p><p>Her Facebook feed is full of pro-gun, anti-Islam, fear and hate mongering. She has many posts that show she is in favor of Donald Trump for the presidency. That really explains it all.</p><p>Obviously, Ray did not respond to media inquiries about the post.</p><p>Ray posted <a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/religion/postal-worker-destroy-mail-muslim-holiday-stamps" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.opposingviews.com/i/religion/postal-worker-destroy-mail-muslim-holiday-stamps&apos;, &apos;this&apos;);" target="_blank">this</a> after the shooting <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/uk-mp-jo-cox-attacked/487316/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/uk-mp-jo-cox-attacked/487316/&apos;, &apos;death&apos;);" target="_blank">death</a> of British lawmaker, Jo Cox:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Wait. Can&#x2019;t be. Guns are strictly prohibited in that district. How could this lady have gotten shot if guns are illegal? &#x2026;&#xA0;</em>Please<em> I need a piece of shit liberal to answer this for me.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!--Ads2--><br>
