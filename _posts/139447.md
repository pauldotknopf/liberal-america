<p>In case it has escaped your notice, the U.S. will be having a pretty important election this November. We&#x2019;ll be picking the next occupant of the famous Oval Office, and that&#x2019;s a big deal.</p><p>Which means that we all need to get out there and vote, vote, vote!</p><p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/briggles/registering-to-vote-with-president-obama?utm_term=.xr1rB39Jp#.tlQn5xDO0" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.buzzfeed.com/briggles/registering-to-vote-with-president-obama?utm_term=.xr1rB39Jp#.tlQn5xDO0&apos;, &apos;Buzzfeed&apos;);">Buzzfeed</a>&#xA0;wants you to remember that it&#x2019;s your civic duty as an American to cast your vote for the candidate of your choice.&#xA0;They know that a lot of people think its too time consuming to go and register, but they want to tell you that&#x2019;s just a feeble excuse.</p><p>Did you know that there are all kinds of things that are way harder to do than register to vote?</p><p>All kinds of things.</p><p>Buzzfeed put together a list of five of those things, and they asked&#xA0;President Obama to help demonstrate. They went to the Oval Office and filmed the President doing five things that are harder than registering to vote.</p><p>For example, did you know that its harder to make a friendship bracelet for your BFF than it is to go to the City Clerk&#x2019;s Office to register? Here&#x2019;s proof:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Obama stacks cheerios and makes a friendship bracelet in get out the vote video | WATCH: <a href="https://t.co/RUx7IzumoH" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/RUx7IzumoH&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/RUx7IzumoH&apos;);">https://t.co/RUx7IzumoH</a> <a href="https://t.co/VePGc3yP1M" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/VePGc3yP1M&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/VePGc3yP1M&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/VePGc3yP1M</a></p>

</div><p>According to the article it&#x2019;s easier to name&#xA0;every &#x201C;Game of Thrones&#x201D; character who has died so far than it is to register. It&#x2019;s also apparently easier to sign up at the local registrar&#x2019;s office than it is to do anything in that old kid&#x2019;s game &#x201C;Operation.&#x201D;</p><p>Both of those are definitely true for me! I guess President Obama and I have these weaknesses in common.</p><p>You have to check out the really funny BuzzFeedVideo below. The President&#x2019;s facial expressions alone are worth it.</p><p>But first you have to register to vote. You must. You gotta. You need to. Not an option.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re seriously too lazy to drag your butt downtown to sign up at City Hall, you can click this link and Buzzfeed will get you registered. &#xA0;<a href="https://buzzfeed.turbovote.org/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://buzzfeed.turbovote.org/&apos;, &apos;Register right here!&apos;);">Register right here!</a></p><p>Now watch this:</p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5eE7Da_6AMM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>h/t to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/briggles/registering-to-vote-with-president-obama?utm_term=.xr1rB39Jp#.tlQn5xDO0" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.buzzfeed.com/briggles/registering-to-vote-with-president-obama?utm_term=.xr1rB39Jp#.tlQn5xDO0&apos;, &apos;Buzzfeed&apos;);">Buzzfeed</a></p>
