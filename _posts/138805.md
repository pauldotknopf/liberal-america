Hockey trophies, karate belts, proms, diplomas, and degrees, new babies and big promotions. Our kids succeed, and we like the way it reflects back on our great parenting.</p><p>Some people define success a lit bit differently, though. To these people, its not always about earning or gaining.&#xA0;Success isn&#x2019;t always something tangible.</p><p><a href="http://www.faithit.com/burger-king-employee-100-dollar-tip-helping-homeless-man-michelle-resendez/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.faithit.com/burger-king-employee-100-dollar-tip-helping-homeless-man-michelle-resendez/&apos;, &apos;FaithIt&apos;);">FaithIt</a> reported on one such person, and how&#xA0;proud she is of her son.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/michelle.resendez.9" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.facebook.com/michelle.resendez.9&apos;, &apos;Michelle Resendez&apos;);">Michelle Resendez</a> is the mother of a teenage son. Like a lot of other teens, this one has a job&#xA0;in a fast food restaurant. Recently he came home from an evening shift at Burger King and told his Mom about his evening.</p><p>Matthew&#xA0;told his mother that a homeless man had come in&#xA0;with only fifty cents and asked what he could buy. Matthew asked what he&#x2019;d get if he had enough money, and the gentleman answered that anything would help. He was very hungry.</p><p>So the young man put together a big order and then used his own debit card to pay for it.</p><p>That was a wonderful gesture, and the story could have ended there and still gone viral.<br>

Matthew told Michelle that another customer had watched the entire interaction. She was so impressed that she wrote a letter to the Burger King people telling them about their kind and generous young employee.</p><p>She also left the teen a very generous tip.</p><p>Resendez was rightfully proud of her boy. She took to Facebook to share her excitement about her burger making hero.
