</div><p><a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/20/breaking-trump-fires-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski/">Lewandowski was fired</a>&#xA0;this morning in a move that caught the media&#xA0;completely by surprise. This information may shed some light on what happened.</p><p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/print/report-trump-campaign-manager-screamed-youre-fing-dead-to-me-to-press-secretary/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/print/report-trump-campaign-manager-screamed-youre-fing-dead-to-me-to-press-secretary/&apos;, &apos;Mediaite&apos;);">Mediaite</a>&#xA0;is reporting on an interview with Olivia Nuzzi of the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.thedailybeast.com/&apos;, &apos;Daily Beast&apos;);">Daily Beast</a>. Nuzzi recently profiled Trump&#x2019;s Press Secretary Hope Hicks for <a href="http://www.gq.com/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.gq.com/&apos;, &apos;GQ Magazine&apos;);">GQ Magazine</a>. She spoke with several of Hicks&#x2019; current and former colleagues to get a sense of the woman and how she fits within the campaign.</p><p>One of those former colleagues was Sam Nunberg, who worked for Trump for over four-years before leaving to support Ted Cruz.</p><p>Nunberg had plenty to say about Hicks and her relationship to the famously aggressive Lewandowsky. He said that the campaign manager&#xA0;regularly lost his temper with Hicks, often screaming at her until she broke down in tears.</p><p>At only 27-years of age, <a href="http://theslot.jezebel.com/behold-this-glorious-profile-of-hope-hicks-donald-trum-1782277909" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://theslot.jezebel.com/behold-this-glorious-profile-of-hope-hicks-donald-trum-1782277909&apos;, &apos;Hope Hicks&apos;);">Hope Hicks</a> is young to hold such a powerful position in a presidential campaign. &#xA0;She has no political background at all and is well known for her discomfort in dealing with the press.</p><p>She is so shy that when Nuzzi contacted her for an interview, the reticent press secretary declined. Instead, she arranged for Nuzzi to speak directly with Trump about her, while she was in the room.</p><p>How paternalistically creepy!</p><p>It seems that the tender young press secretary was regularly the target of Lewandowski&#x2019;s wrath. In one instance, according to Nunberg, Hicks was thinking of leaving the campaign to return to a position at Trump Tower. The very idea enraged the campaign manager&#xA0;so much that he <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/print/report-trump-campaign-manager-screamed-youre-fing-dead-to-me-to-press-secretary/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.mediaite.com/print/report-trump-campaign-manager-screamed-youre-fing-dead-to-me-to-press-secretary/&apos;, &apos;screamed&apos;);">screamed</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;You made a big f***ing mistake; you&#x2019;re f***ing dead to me!&#x201D;</span></em></p><p class="p1">Hicks dissolved in tears, and stayed with the campaign.</p><p class="p1">
</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>The fact that Lewandowski is comfortable bullying young women should be no surprise. He first gained headlines when he was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-trump-campaign-manager.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-trump-campaign-manager.html&apos;, &apos;charged with battery&apos;);">charged with battery</a> for physically grabbing a woman journalist as she tried to ask Trump a question.</p><p class="p1">Apparently, he was just as much of a loudmouthed jerk within the campaign itself.</p><p class="p1">News of Lewandowski&#x2019;s firing was released to the press by none other than Hope Hicks.</p><p class="p1">That had to feel good.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>
