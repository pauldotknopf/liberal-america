<p>We&#x2019;ve known for some time&#xA0;that the religious right&#x2013;or at least, a large sector of it&#x2013;is flocking to Donald Trump after initially keeping its distance. Well, that flood may become even larger. One of the nation&#x2019;s most prominent culture warriors <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/us/politics/a-born-again-donald-trump-believe-it-evangelical-leader-says.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/us/politics/a-born-again-donald-trump-believe-it-evangelical-leader-says.html&apos;, &apos;says&apos;);">says</a> that the Donald has been saved and is now one of them.</p><p>You may recall that last Tuesday, Trump held a closed-door meeting with several prominent Christianists, at which he announced the formation of an &#x201C;Evangelical Executive Advisory Board&#x201D; intended to help build bridges between the presumptive GOP nominee and one of the party&#x2019;s largest constituencies. After the meeting, Michael Anthony, pastor of Grace Fellowship in York, Pennsylvania; collared one of the board&#x2019;s members, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson,&#xA0;for an interview.</p><p>During this chat, Dobson dropped a bombshell&#x2013;Trump had recently been saved. Fundie radio show TruNews got a clip; listen here.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nsB4DvJBhbo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>Dobson said that a number of evangelical pastors had been &#x201C;ministering to him (Trump) personally,&#x201D; and as a result of one of those contacts, &#x201C;he did accept a relationship with Christ.&#x201D; He added that it came &#x201C;fairly recent(ly).&#x201D; Dobson believed that&#xA0;Trump&#xA0;is a &#x201C;baby Christian&#x201D; whose&#xA0;commitment was real, but that he didn&#x2019;t &#x201C;know our language&#x201D; just yet. For instance, he said &#x201C;hell&#x201D; no fewer than four times.</p><p>Listen to the whole thing <a href="http://www.godfactor.com/blog/exclusive-interview-with-dr-james-dobson-did-donald-trump-recently-accept-christ" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.godfactor.com/blog/exclusive-interview-with-dr-james-dobson-did-donald-trump-recently-accept-christ&apos;, &apos;here&apos;);">here</a>. Dobson said that Trump was &#x201C;a lot nicer guy&#x201D; than his public persona.&#xA0;Anthony noticed it as well; he likened Trump to the Apostle Paul. Dobson thinks that Trump is still a bit rough around the edges, mainly because &#x201C;he didn&#x2019;t grow up like us.&#x201D;</p><p>However, Trump is certainly talking like them. In a meeting with a smaller group of fundies on Tuesday, Trump openly&#xA0;claimed that &#x201C;we don&#x2019;t know anything&#x201D; about Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s faith commitment.</p><p>Later, Dobson <a href="http://drjamesdobson.org/resources/culture-watch" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://drjamesdobson.org/resources/culture-watch&apos;, &apos;revealed on his blog&apos;);">revealed on his blog</a> that prosperity gospel evangelist Paula White, another member of the advisory board, was the one who helped Trump get saved. As Dobson sees it, &#x201C;we have only two choices&#x201D;&#x2013;and the thought of having Hillary as president scares him.</p><p>Color this left-leaning charismatic/pentecostal Christian skeptical. Maybe it&#x2019;s because Trump has yet to&#xA0;apologize to Jorge Ramos for <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/06/27/donald-trump-plasters-private-cell-phone-number-of-anchorman-jorge-ramos-online/">plastering his private cell phone number</a> on social media. Or to <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/11/26/donald-trump-how-dare-you-call-me-out-for-mocking-a-disabled-person-with-video/">apologize</a> to Serge Kovaleski for <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/05/18/donald-trump-tries-explain-mocked-disabled-fails/">mocking his disability</a>. Or to disavow the <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/11/27/donald-trump-could-face-lawsuit-for-supporters-assault-on-protester-with-video/">out-and-out thuggery</a> we&#x2019;ve seen from his supporters.</p>
