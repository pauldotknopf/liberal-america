<p>Being fired from a job is very embarrassing. It can really hurt your pride. However, could&#xA0;you imagine your former employer getting mad when you find a new job?</p><p>This week, Donald Trump (R-NY) fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at the request of his children.</p><p>There is a big <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/23/media/corey-lewandowski-cnn/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/23/media/corey-lewandowski-cnn/index.html&apos;, &apos;issue&apos;);" target="_blank">issue</a> with this. Lewandowski most likely signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump&#x2019;s campaign. Often, these documents include a non-disparagement clause, so Lewandowski may not be allowed to comment against Donald Trump.</p><p>Trump is still mad at CNN for other reasons. He has been tweeting for weeks about them lying. In June, he has tweeted six times about CNN lying about him.</p><p>Trump said CNN also lied about his <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/23/cnns-tom-foreman-caught-lying-in-trump-refugees-fact-check/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/23/cnns-tom-foreman-caught-lying-in-trump-refugees-fact-check/&apos;, &apos;speech&apos;);" target="_blank">speech</a> on refugees. CNN contributor Tom Foreman said that Trump was lying when, for once, he actually wasn&#x2019;t. In his defense, Trump actually telling the truth is a bit rare.</p><p>He referred to the part of the speech where Trump said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Under her [Clinton&#x2019;s] plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth &#x2013; with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Forman distorted the statement by saying that Trump said Clinton herself would admit the refugees. However, Trump said that the U.S. would admit those refugees.</p><p>Foreman also <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/23/cnns-tom-foreman-caught-lying-in-trump-refugees-fact-check/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/23/cnns-tom-foreman-caught-lying-in-trump-refugees-fact-check/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a> that the statement referred to just Syrian refugees. However, Trump said that the refugees would be from &#x201C;the most dangerous countries on Earth.&#x201D;</p><p>This is by far not the first time Trump has <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/04/04/watch-megyn-kelly-says-recieved-death-threats-trump-attacked/" target="_blank">feuded</a> with media outlets. We all know about his long-standing feud with Megyn Kelly on Fox News.</p><p>With the refugees remark, it is hard to tell if Trump is just mad at CNN for snagging Lewandowski or if this is just normal media feuding. The Donald is definitely unhappy with CNN either way.</p><p>Here is Corey Lewandowski&#x2019;s debut on CNN:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6iNhQfQcuC0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
