</div><p>There are some racially-charged aspects of the presumptive GOP nominee&#x2019;s campaign, which makes this old interview he&#xA0;gave in 1989 for an NBC discussion about race in America relevant again.</p><p>On September 5, 1989, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ekdCYzRDQ" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ekdCYzRDQ&apos;, &apos;NBC News&apos;);">NBC News</a> aired a program exploring the subject of race in the U.S.. The real estate mogul was interviewed and shared the following insight:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve said on occasion, even about myself, if I were starting off today I would love to be a well-educated black because I really believe they do have an actual advantage today.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Trump actually seems to be under the impression that his life would have been for the better had he been born African-American. At least he thinks the well-educated black Trump would have a tremendous advantage, over the well-educated white Trump, when it comes to getting a job.</p><p>However, others in the program did not agree. Spike Lee, the African-American film director, was later interviewed and dismissed Trump&#x2019;s comment:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I certainly don&#x2019;t agree with that garbage Donald Trump said.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Actually, Lee was in disbelief that the real estate mogul&#xA0;could actually have been ignorant enough about the discrimination of African-Americans to have made that comment:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe he said that, because that&#x2019;s just crazy.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Well, by now, having endured Trump&#x2019;s views of Mexicans, Muslims, women, and more, Lee may finally believe what Trump says are&#xA0;real statements, even if they do at times sound completely crazy indeed.</p><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5-ekdCYzRDQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
