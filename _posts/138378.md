<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>In case my state didn&#x2019;t have enough scandals, a Congressman has created another one. Last week, Trevor Noah even talked about <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/16/watch-trevor-noah-slams-trinity-republican-corruption-alabama/">the scandals</a> going on here. Our Governor had a sex scandal. Our Chief Supreme Court Justice refuses to uphold the gay marriage ruling.</p><p>Finally, Former Speaker Hubbard was found guilty of 12 counts of corruption for funneling money into a printing business.</p><div id="attachment_138391" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-138391" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5861306013_a824da719a_z1.jpg?resize=640%2C478" alt="congressman" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5861306013_a824da719a_z1.jpg?resize=640%2C478 640w, http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5861306013_a824da719a_z1.jpg?resize=640%2C478 64w, http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5861306013_a824da719a_z1.jpg?resize=640%2C478 350w, http://i2.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5861306013_a824da719a_z1.jpg?resize=640%2C478 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>Now, some of the nation&#x2019;s largest Muslim advocacy groups&#xA0;are demanding an apology from Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks. Brooks was on a radio show just four days after the Orlando shooting and <a href="http://www.waff.com/story/32268463/islamic-community-demanding-apology-from-al-congressman" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.waff.com/story/32268463/islamic-community-demanding-apology-from-al-congressman&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The Democrats are in a perplexing position. On the one hand, they&#x2019;re trying to appeal to the gay community, but, on the other hand, they&#x2019;re trying to also appeal to the Muslim community, which, if it had its way, would kill every homosexual in the United States of America.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The Muslim group invited Brooks to a Ramadan Interfaith Dinner at a local mosque. Ramadan will be over at the end of June; hopefully Brooks will accept the invitation to mend fences with the Islamic community.</p><p>So many people believe that all Muslims are hateful and evil. This is not true. The Quran actually tells Muslims to &#x201C;compete&#x201D; to do <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/04/30/using-quran-prove-islam-religion-peace-not-oxymoron-video/" target="_blank">good deeds</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We have appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. Had God willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good. Every one of you will return to God and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.&#x201D; (Surat al-Ma&#x2019;ida, 48)</em></p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>President Obama reminded us of the real enemy after the Orlando attack. He <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/13/why-do-republicans-think-the-term-radical-islamic-terrorism-is-so-important/" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam. These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy. And all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam</em>,<em> because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This is not the first time Brooks said something stupid. In this segment, he talks about a fictional &#x201C;War on Whites:&#x201D;</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KPKitcoKuEo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
