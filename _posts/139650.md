<p>A Cook County, Illinois, judge <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/42db4669f3ef4dffa34b513b3da75f81/judge-orders-illinois-add-ptsd-medical-marijuana-list" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/42db4669f3ef4dffa34b513b3da75f81/judge-orders-illinois-add-ptsd-medical-marijuana-list&apos;, &apos;ruled&apos;);" target="_blank">ruled</a> that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) should be added to the list of conditions that qualify to receive&#xA0;medical marijuana. Judge Neil Cohen also said that the state engaged in a private investigation which was &#x201C;constitutionally inappropriate.&#x201D;</p><p>People can petition the government to get conditions added to the list. They were getting frustrated because Gov. Bruce Rauner&#x2019;s administration has denied all of these petitions to get PTSD on the list.&#xA0;There have been several lawsuits filed on the topic.</p><p>This&#xA0;lawsuit was filed by an Iraqi War veteran. Judge Cohen ordered that PTSD be added to the list within the next 30 days.</p><p>The advisory board voted unanimously to add PTSD to the list, but the Illinois Department of Public Health Director, Nirav Shah, conducted his own investigation, and rejected it because their &#x201C;standard&#x201D; of medical evidence <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/42db4669f3ef4dffa34b513b3da75f81/judge-orders-illinois-add-ptsd-medical-marijuana-list" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/42db4669f3ef4dffa34b513b3da75f81/judge-orders-illinois-add-ptsd-medical-marijuana-list&apos;, &apos;said PTSD&apos;);">said PTSD</a> &#x201C;appears nowhere in the Act or the Department&#x2019;s rules.&#x201D;</p><p>Judge Cohen <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-illinois-medical-marijuana-ptsd-ruling-met-20160628-story.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-illinois-medical-marijuana-ptsd-ruling-met-20160628-story.html&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a> in the ruling:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The Director&#x2019;s legal duty was to review the evidence, review the advisory board&#x2019;s recommendations based thereon and render a final decision accepting or denying the proposal,&#x201D; the judge wrote. &#x201C;Instead, Director Shah engaged in a private investigation, hidden from public view and more importantly, hidden from the parties, and arrived at his conclusion based thereon. This process was constitutionally inappropriate.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The Judge requested a follow-up hearing to make sure they comply. The list currently contains over 40 conditions including cancer, arthritis, or Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.</p><p>Gov. Rauner is not a big fan of the medical marijuana <a href="http://capitolfax.com/2016/05/27/deal-emerges-on-medical-marijuana/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://capitolfax.com/2016/05/27/deal-emerges-on-medical-marijuana/&apos;, &apos;program&apos;);" target="_blank">program</a>, but he&#x2019;s compromised, and the state now has a law for this.&#xA0;They extended the program until 2020.</p><p>Also, doctors will no longer have to recommend cannabis, they just have to certify that the patient has a qualifying condition that allows them to purchase it.</p><p>They are also changing the procedure to get new conditions added to the list, so hopefully it won&#x2019;t be so difficult to do this anymore.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0g7HnFN5wP8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
