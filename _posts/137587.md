Bush, said he <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/richard-armitage-endorses-clinton-224431#ixzz4BlhDwOtW" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/richard-armitage-endorses-clinton-224431#ixzz4BlhDwOtW&apos;, &apos;is backing&apos;);">is backing</a> former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) instead of Donald Trump (R-N.Y.). Armitage was also an assistant secretary of state under former President Ronald Reagan, and is a retired navy officer.</p><p>He is thought to be the highest-ranking former security officers to back Sec.&#xA0;Clinton over Trump. Armitage <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/richard-armitage-endorses-clinton-224431#ixzz4BlhDwOtW" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/richard-armitage-endorses-clinton-224431#ixzz4BlhDwOtW&apos;, &apos;told&apos;);" target="_blank">told</a> POLITICO:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;If Donald Trump is the nominee, I would vote for Hillary Clinton &#x2026; He doesn&#x2019;t appear to be a Republican, he doesn&#x2019;t appear to want to learn about issues. So, I&#x2019;m going to vote for Mrs. Clinton.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Armitage is not the only one to come out against Trump. The Donald doesn&#x2019;t have good foreign policy plans. Although many Republicans are backing him now, foreign security experts are rallying against The Donald.</p><p>Another commander,&#xA0;retired four-star Marine Gen. James T. Mattis, considered <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/richard-armitage-endorses-clinton-224431#ixzz4BlhDwOtW" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/richard-armitage-endorses-clinton-224431#ixzz4BlhDwOtW&apos;, &apos;joining&apos;);" target="_blank">joining</a> the 2016 presidential race as an Independent candidate. We don&#x2019;t know yet if he actually will do it.</p><p>We don&#x2019;t know if more Republicans will join Armitage or not. Armitage did say that many of his colleagues with national security backgrounds are &#x201C;confused&#x201D; about the choice before them.</p><p>In April, Donald Trump gave what was supposed to be his big <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/04/28/blatant-inconsistencies-trumps-foreign-policy-address/" target="_blank">foreign policy speech</a>.&#xA0;First, he said we are getting out of the &#x201C;nation-building&#x201D; business. Then, he said that we could spread Western values all over the world.</p><p>Although Trump said he would ban Muslims from entering the country, he also said the Middle East would have to cooperate with him:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them.&#x201D;</em></p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>There was another big contradiction in Trump&#x2019;s speech. He said tat America is going to be a &#x201C;reliable friend and ally.&#x201D; Then, he went back on this, saying:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense &#x2013; and, if not, the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.&#x201D;</em></p><p>I can see why these national security experts would want to distance themselves from The Donald. He can&#x2019;t make up his mind. He can&#x2019;t get through a speech without contradicting himself.</p><p>How is this going to work when he uses these lies on foreign leaders?</p><p>Watch this video report on Armitage for more information about&#xA0;his <a href="https://youtu.be/EAqINFsB4S8" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://youtu.be/EAqINFsB4S8&apos;, &apos;choice to back&apos;);">choice to back</a> Sec.
