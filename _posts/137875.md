<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>A conservative Republican is the&#xA0;last person you might expect to speak at a vigil for LGBT Americans, but that is exactly what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/utah-republican-is-unlikely-star-at-lgbt-vigil-for-orlando.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/utah-republican-is-unlikely-star-at-lgbt-vigil-for-orlando.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&apos;, &apos;happened&apos;);" target="_blank">happened</a> on Monday in Salt Lake City, Utah. The result was a beautiful moment of love and acceptance that crossed party lines.</p><p>Spencer Cox (R-Utah) is the state&#x2019;s Lieutenant Governor and a party leader. In a speech at a vigil held for the victims of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Cox apologized for his past treatment of LGBT individuals:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;There were some kids in my class that were different than me, and sometimes I wasn&#x2019;t kind to them. I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay. I regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity and respect &#x2014; the love &#x2014; that they deserved. For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize.&#x201D;</em></p><p>He went on to praise the LGBT community for their patience and openness in spite of past treatment:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You have treated me with the kindness, dignity, and respect &#x2014; the love &#x2014; that I very often did not deserve. And it has made me love you.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Cox also acknowledged that the fact that the Orlando victims were mostly LGBT was significant, even when many Republicans refuse to confront that fact.</p><p>The decision to invite Cox to speak was controversial. The LGBT community has not had the most friendly relationship with the Republican leadership in the state over the past few years. But Equality Utah invited him anyway, not knowing exactly what Cox was going to say.</p><p>They were blown away. The director of Equality Utah called the resulting speech <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/utah-republican-is-unlikely-star-at-lgbt-vigil-for-orlando.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/utah-republican-is-unlikely-star-at-lgbt-vigil-for-orlando.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&apos;, &apos;beautiful&apos;);" target="_blank">beautiful</a>, and expressed hope that this will open a more productive dialogue with state leaders.</p><p>Perhaps there is hope for America, after all. The sad part is that we had to lose so many wonderful people.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/S2kbPZataqQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Feature image via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2kbPZataqQ" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2kbPZataqQ&apos;, &apos;Youtube&apos;);" target="_blank">Youtube</a></em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
