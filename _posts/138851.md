Yesterday, we experienced one of the biggest political events of this administration. In the aftermath of the Orlando attack, the House Democrats <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/22/breaking-house-democrats-stage-sit-in-over-gun-violence-video/" target="_blank">staged</a> a sit-in. They all sat down in the middle of the floor in Congress and are staying there until the&#xA0;House allows a&#xA0;vote on gun control measures.</p><p>Gabrielle Giffords, former Arizona Congresswoman, is a <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congresswoman-gabrielle-giffords-injured-in-shooting-rampage" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congresswoman-gabrielle-giffords-injured-in-shooting-rampage&apos;, &apos;survivor&apos;);" target="_blank">survivor</a> of gun violence. She was shot at a constituents meeting in Tuscon. Six people died and thirteen people, including her, were injured.</p><p>In response to the sit-in, she sent this beautiful <a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/06/23/read-gabby-giffords-beautiful-letter-in-solidarity-with-democratic-sit-in/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/06/23/read-gabby-giffords-beautiful-letter-in-solidarity-with-democratic-sit-in/&apos;, &apos;letter&apos;);" target="_blank">letter</a> to her Democratic colleagues:</p><blockquote id="2bce" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p"><p><em>It&#x2019;s been said that hope was forged of two powerful ingredients: anger at how things are, and the courage to change them. We will not be driven backwards to live in isolation from one another and in fear of violence.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p id="a013" class="graf--p graf-after--pullquote"><em>Thanks to you&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and millions of Americans who share our values of pluralism, liberty, and responsibility&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;we will stand strong and work toward a safer nation for all of us.</em></p>
