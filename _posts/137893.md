<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>This is not your typical story about Donald Trump. Not even close.</p><p>MikeDiva is well-known on YouTube as one of the most talented video makers working today. And now he&#x2019;s decided to add some cuteness to Trump, a man who is anything but cute in word or deed.</p><p>The result is a commercial in which a young girl gazes longingly at&#xA0;a framed portrait of Trump Suddenly, the photo winks at her, and her television tunes to a show where it is announced that Trump is now &#x201C;World President.&#x201D;</p><p>As if that&#x2019;s not strange enough, the girl is then transported to a surreal world where there are&#xA0;Trump Trees, candy skies, and even&#xA0;alpaca Trump. There are also tanks, fighter jets, and a Transporter-styled Trump&#xA0;building his wall before he finally bombs the planet and reduces it to rubble.</p><p>Yeah, I know: <em>WTF?!</em></p><p>What in the world would possess someone such as MikeDiva to create such a bizarre video? On Twitter, Diva remarked:</p><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Here&#x2019;s another factoid you might enjoy:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun Fact: The Japanese word for &quot;cute&quot; (kawaii) is remarkably similar to the Japanese word for &quot;scary&quot; (kowai) <a href="https://t.co/2j0vQJE039" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/2j0vQJE039&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/2j0vQJE039&apos;);">https://t.co/2j0vQJE039</a></p>
