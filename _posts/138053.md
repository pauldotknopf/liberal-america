<p><!--OffDef--></p><p><!--Ads1--></p><p>Perhaps Donald Trump has indeed lost his freaking mind. It has long been speculated that he is in the early stages of some debilitating mental disease such as dementia, and when you listen to some of the crap he says, it does make you start to consider the truth of such a hypothesis.</p><p>Campaigning in Arizona on Saturday, Trump <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/284027-trump-i-feel-like-a-supermodel" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/284027-trump-i-feel-like-a-supermodel&apos;, &apos;told the audience&apos;);" target="_blank">told the audience</a> at his rally:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I feel like a supermodel, except like times 10.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Trump was making reference to the extensive media coverage he&#x2019;s gotten since he decided to run for the White House. He <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/284027-trump-i-feel-like-a-supermodel" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/284027-trump-i-feel-like-a-supermodel&apos;, &apos;then added&apos;);" target="_blank">then added</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s true. I&#x2019;m a supermodel. I&#x2019;m on the cover of these magazines &#x2014; I&#x2019;m on the cover of the biggest magazines. I don&#x2019;t even know about it. I can&#x2019;t even read the story, because if I did, I wouldn&#x2019;t get any work done.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Did you catch the lie there? He doesn&#x2019;t even know about it, but he knows he&#x2019;s on the cover of the biggest magazines. So which one is it? Trump lies so much that every other word out of his mouth contradicts the one that preceded it.</p><p>Finally, this vain&#xA0;bag of intestinal gas <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/284027-trump-i-feel-like-a-supermodel" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/284027-trump-i-feel-like-a-supermodel&apos;, &apos;told the crowd&apos;);" target="_blank">told the crowd</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about me&#x2026;I&#x2019;m doing a good job as a messenger.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit! It&#x2019;s <em>all</em> about him; always has been and always will be.</p><p>Still, if you want to see something truly frightening, just imagine Donald Trump as a supermodel:</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-138056 size-full" src="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/218.jpg?resize=360%2C309" alt="2" srcset="//i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/218.jpg?resize=360%2C309 360w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/218.jpg?resize=360%2C309 64w, //i1.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/218.jpg?resize=360%2C309 350w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Time for me to go wash out my eyes with Clorox, but I&#x2019;ll leave you with a video of Trump speaking in Arizona yesterday:</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4PhKeOv46Jc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
