</div><p>Recently he talked about Donald Trump on Fox News in an interview on &#x201C;The Alan Colmes Show<em>.&#x201D;</em> Here is what he had to <a href="http://usajournalist.com/republicans/deepak-chopra-donald-trump-is-emotionally-retarded-maybe-mentally-retarded/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://usajournalist.com/republicans/deepak-chopra-donald-trump-is-emotionally-retarded-maybe-mentally-retarded/&apos;, &apos;say&apos;);" target="_blank">say</a> about the Republican front-runner:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I would never say this unless I believed it was 100% true, but he represents the racist, the bigot, the one who&#x2019;s prejudiced, the one who is full of fear and hatred, the one who represents emotional retardation of a three-year old. And yet he&#x2019;s so popular because he&#x2019;s given permission to our collective psyche to express their darkest demons.&#x201D;&#xA0;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I think he&#x2019;s racist, he&#x2019;s bigoted, he&#x2019;s prejudiced. He&#x2019;s full of fear. He is angry. He has a lot of hatred. He pouts, he&#x2019;s belligerent, he&#x2019;s emotionally retarded.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Further on in the interview, Chopra said:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Maybe I was too kind when I said he was emotionally retarded, maybe he&#x2019;s mentally retarded too.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Chopra is known as a spiritual leader in the New Age moment, so this is uncharacteristic of him to say it. He says that Trump &#x201C;brings out the worst in him.&#x201D; I understand, we are all angry about Donald Trump.</p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>In his <a href="https://www.deepakchopra.com/blog/article/5610" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.deepakchopra.com/blog/article/5610&apos;, &apos;column&apos;);" target="_blank">column</a>, he expressed shock about Trump&#x2019;s followers. No matter how many times we say how racist or homophobic or xenophobic or everything else Trump is, his followers don&#x2019;t care. Trump has divided the electorate.</p><p>He said that the fact that the Republicans are endorsing him anyway just shows how dysfunctional the party has become. He said &#x201C;Trump-ism&#x201D; is the disease and we need to cure it. Obviously, we also need to find better candidates.</p><p>This is the interview on Fox News:</p>
