<p>So how&#x2019;s that whole Trump 2.0 reboot going? He fired his longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, gave one speech filled with blatant lies about Hillary Clinton, and then traveled to Scotland to promote a golf course right as Britain was voting to leave the European Union. Oh, and his campaign only has $1.3 million in cash on hand. In other words, the more things change with Donald Trump, the more they stay the same.</p><p>GOP consultants <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-delegates-speech_us_576da0c3e4b0dbb1bbbaa208?tabuhytjp0qe86ko6r" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-delegates-speech_us_576da0c3e4b0dbb1bbbaa208?tabuhytjp0qe86ko6r&apos;, &apos;who were asked&apos;);" target="_blank">who were asked</a> to grade Trump&#x2019;s performance this week were only impressed with one thing he did: the speech he gave in which he attacked Clinton and claimed she would be bad for the American economy.</p><p>Trump is also facing open revolt among some Republicans who are actively working to deny him the nomination at the convention in July. Several strategists are trying to get the GOP rules committee to unbind all of the currently bound delegates so they can vote for whoever they want to. This is forcing Trump to spend money in order to forestall such a move.&#xA0;Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, leader of the &#x201C;Free the Delegates&#x201D; movement, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-delegates-speech_us_576da0c3e4b0dbb1bbbaa208?tabuhytjp0qe86ko6r" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-delegates-speech_us_576da0c3e4b0dbb1bbbaa208?tabuhytjp0qe86ko6r&apos;, &apos;commented&apos;);" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s spending campaign money that should be used against Hillary Clinton to smack down dissent. That doesn&#x2019;t bode well.&#x201D;</em></p><p>And GOP consultant&#xA0;Matt Mackowiak was more blunt in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-delegates-speech_us_576da0c3e4b0dbb1bbbaa208?tabuhytjp0qe86ko6r" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-delegates-speech_us_576da0c3e4b0dbb1bbbaa208?tabuhytjp0qe86ko6r&apos;, &apos;his assessment&apos;);" target="_blank">his assessment</a> of the Trump reboot which was in evidence this week:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;He had one good day because he didn&#x2019;t vomit all over himself and gave a decent speech. Is he in a better place than he was last weekend? Yes.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Better place than last weekend. One good day in an entire week. This is the new standard for Donald Trump as he runs for President? They must be doing cartwheels over at the Clinton campaign.</p>
