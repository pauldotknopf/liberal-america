<p>Steven Anderson is the pastor of&#xA0;Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona, and he&#x2019;s also one of the most disgusting and reprehensible human beings to ever walk upon the face of the earth. This monumental so-called Christian hates everyone: Muslims, Jews, women, the LGBT community, and anyone who dares to disagree with his interpretation of the Bible.</p><p>But now Anderson has sunk to an all-time low, even for him. In a recent sermon, this asshat said that he wanted to draw his congregation&#x2019;s attention to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm&apos;, &apos;Psalm 58:10&apos;);" target="_blank">Psalm 58:10</a>, which reads:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Anderson referenced this passage of the Old Testament because he said it applies today to homosexuals, whom he called &#x201C;reprobates,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39eg3woLhGM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39eg3woLhGM&apos;, &apos;then added&apos;);" target="_blank">then added</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Why would God want us to sing about washing our feet in the blood of the wicked in the New Testament? Can someone explain that to me? Because it&#x2019;s &#xA0;valid today. Because it still stands. Because God is still the same God.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Yes, Steven Anderson just said that Christians should wash their feet in the blood of any LGBT person they happen to come across because that&#x2019;s what God wants, even today.</p><p>As if that wasn&#x2019;t enough, Anderson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39eg3woLhGM" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39eg3woLhGM&apos;, &apos;then claimed&apos;);" target="_blank">then claimed</a> that homosexuals don&#x2019;t enjoy the same things as &#x201C;normal&#x201D; people. Things such as loving another person, walking in the park, taking their dog for a stroll:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Who here struggles really hard to not be a homo. I mean it&#x2019;s really hard. Other men are just so appealing and it&#x2019;s a struggle &#x2013; No, you&#x2019;re like gross, it&#x2019;s disgusting. Look, the only way that a dude would lust after another dude is if God gave him over unto vile affections to do those things.&#x201D;</em></p><p>But it&#x2019;s quite apparent to me that Steven Anderson has never bothered to read the words of the person he claims as his savior, Jesus Christ, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm&apos;, &apos;who said&apos;);" target="_blank">who said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Do not judge, or you too will be judged.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Pastor Anderson has a lot of judgment coming his way. Instead of hating on others, he should be down on his knees begging for forgiveness from the God he pretends to serve.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s Steven Anderson on one of his rants:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/39eg3woLhGM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
