<p>A few years ago, the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/ngi" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/ngi&apos;, &apos;FBI&apos;);">FBI</a>&#xA0;moved toward using a new biometric database to monitor for possible criminal activity. States were asked to fingerprint everyone in a position of &#x201C;trust.&#x201D; Public school teachers, assistant teachers, bus drivers, and day care workers were among those required&#xA0;to submit to the procedure.</p><p>The FBI wanted to provide more than a one time snapshot as a background check. As part of a program called&#xA0;<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/ngi" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/ngi&apos;, &apos;Rap Back&apos;);">Rap Back</a>, the FBI would be able to compare our fingerprints to crimes committed around the country on an ongoing basis.</p><p>As a public school teacher of long standing, I found the request a little bit humiliating and semi-threatening. I had been teaching for more than&#xA0;30 years without incident.</p><p>But you know what? My colleagues and I had ourselves fingerprinted and put into the national database. We even paid the $55 cost.</p><p>We did it because it was worth it to us to submit to ongoing government monitoring that might make life safer for children. We figured that since we had nothing to hide, there was no real risk to us.</p><p>The safety of innocent children came first.</p><p>Now <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hawaii-just-put-gun-owners-on-an-fbi-database-and-the-nra-is-freaking-out/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hawaii-just-put-gun-owners-on-an-fbi-database-and-the-nra-is-freaking-out/&apos;, &apos;RawStory&apos;);">RawStory</a> is reporting that Hawaii has become the first state to expand the Rap Back program to gun owners. The state already requires all gun owners to register their weapons.</p><p>Now, Hawaii will place those gun owners&#x2019; information into the Rap Back database. That way if they are arrested anywhere in the U.S., the FBI can notify local police.</p><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>The National Rifle Association (NRA) is predictably having a tantrum.&#xA0;<span class="s1">Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the NRA&#x2019;s institute for legislative action <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hawaii-just-put-gun-owners-on-an-fbi-database-and-the-nra-is-freaking-out/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/hawaii-just-put-gun-owners-on-an-fbi-database-and-the-nra-is-freaking-out/&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>:</span></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking: exercising constitutional rights in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hawaii?src=hash" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hawaii?src=hash&apos;, &apos;#Hawaii&apos;);">#Hawaii</a> now gets you entered into a federal watchlist, er, database <a href="https://t.co/kL4YSPZnwc" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/kL4YSPZnwc&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/kL4YSPZnwc&apos;);">https://t.co/kL4YSPZnwc</a></p>
