<!--Ads1--></p><p>The nation is still reeling from the <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/12/50-confirmed-dead-53-wounded-worst-mass-shooting-us-history/" target="_blank">horror</a> that took place in Orlando on Sunday. This is the worst mass shooting in U.S. history since 9/11. Fifty people died and over 50 were wounded. This hateful shooter, Omar Mateen,&#xA0;went into the&#xA0;gay nightclub Pulse and opened fire.</p><p>Right-wing extremists, hateful Christians, and homophobic bigots are <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/13/rwnj-pastor-spews-hate-filled-rhetoric-response-orlando-lgbt-shooting/" target="_blank">celebrating</a>&#xA0;the&#xA0;horrific attack. One pastor said that it was good news, and he was celebrating the deaths of 50 &#x201C;pedophiles.&#x201D;</p><p>This is some of the <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/13/rwnj-pastor-spews-hate-filled-rhetoric-response-orlando-lgbt-shooting/" target="_blank">hate</a> that Pastor Steven Anderson was spewing (keep a barf bag handy):</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The good news is that </em>there&#x2019;s<em> 50 </em>less<em> pedophiles in this world, because, you know, these homosexuals are a bunch of disgusting perverts and pedophiles. That&#x2019;s who was a victim here, are a bunch of, just, disgusting homosexuals at a gay bar, okay?&#x201D;</em></p><p>One Catholic bishop is admitting that religion plays a role in LGBT hatred. Bishop Robert Lynch wrote this on his personal <a href="http://bishopsblog.dosp.org/?p=6644" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://bishopsblog.dosp.org/?p=6644&apos;, &apos;blog&apos;);" target="_blank">blog</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Second, sadly it is religion, including our own, which targets, mostly verbally, and also often breeds contempt for gays, lesbians, and transgender people. Attacks today on LGBT men and women often plant the seed of contempt, then hatred, which can ultimately lead to violence. Those women and men who were mowed down early yesterday morning were all made in the image and likeness of God. We teach that. We should believe that. We must stand for that. Without yet knowing who perpetrated the PULSE mass murders, when I saw the Imam come forward at a press conference yesterday morning, I knew that somewhere in the story there would be a search to find religious roots. While deranged people do senseless things, all of us observe, judge and act from some kind of religious background. Singling out people for victimization because of their religion, their sexual orientation, their nationality must be offensive to God&#x2019;s ears. It has to stop also.&#x201D;</em></p><p>His full post is a great <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/florida-catholic-bishop-sadly-it-is-religion-including-our-own-that-breeds-contempt-for-gays/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/florida-catholic-bishop-sadly-it-is-religion-including-our-own-that-breeds-contempt-for-gays/&apos;, &apos;read&apos;);" target="_blank">read</a> if you are interested.<br>

Obviously, Omar Mateen was influenced by his religion to commit this violent act. I wish that all of these extremists could just stop hating other people for the way they live.</p><p>Those beautiful people at Pulse were just trying to enjoy a space where they thought they wouldn&#x2019;t be ridiculed. No one should have to die because of who they are.</p><p>This video is The Young Turks&#x2019;<a href="https://youtu.be/blVpOLIFxCA" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://youtu.be/blVpOLIFxCA&apos;, &apos; coverage&apos;);"> coverage</a> on this subject:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/blVpOLIFxCA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
