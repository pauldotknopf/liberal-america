<p>Casey Nocket has been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/woman-banned-from-all-us-national-parks-for-scrawling-her-instag/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/woman-banned-from-all-us-national-parks-for-scrawling-her-instag/&apos;, &apos;banned&apos;);" target="_blank">banned</a> from entering any of our National Parks for&#xA0;two years along with probation and community service for defacing rocks. The idiot drew graffiti, including her Instagram handle, on rock formations in a few parks. As if that wasn&#x2019;t stupid enough, she posted pictures of the graffiti itself as well as pictures of her committing these acts.</p><p>U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/woman-banned-from-all-us-national-parks-for-scrawling-her-instag/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/woman-banned-from-all-us-national-parks-for-scrawling-her-instag/&apos;, &apos;said this&apos;);" target="_blank">said this</a> about the incident and the cleanup efforts:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The defendant&#x2019;s defacement of multiple rock formations showed a lack of respect for the law and our shared national treasures.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The National Park Service has worked hard to restore the rock formations to their natural state, completing clean-up efforts in five of the seven national parks.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>They expect to complete clean-up efforts at Death Valley and at Crater Lake national parks as weather permits.&#x201D;</em></p><p>She painted these faces with acrylic paint on several rock formations during a 26-day period in 2014.</p><p>It has been difficult to remove many of these faces because chemical-stripping techniques could permanently damage these beautiful rock formations.</p><p>How was she found? An online mob on the popular website, Reddit, found Ms. Nocket. One Reddit user <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graffiti-artist-banned-from-parks_us_576c0280e4b0795798cb4ffb" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graffiti-artist-banned-from-parks_us_576c0280e4b0795798cb4ffb&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);" target="_blank">said</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I wonder if its possible to get some sorta action against this person? Her name on Instagram shows her FB page as well so shes [sic] not hard to find &#x2026;&#xA0;&#x201D;</em></p><p>This caught the attention of Steve Yu, an investigator for Yosemite National Park. He posted his contact information and asked for information on this woman.</p><p>The magazine Modern Hiker reported on these pictures and she <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graffiti-artist-banned-from-parks_us_576c0280e4b0795798cb4ffb" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graffiti-artist-banned-from-parks_us_576c0280e4b0795798cb4ffb&apos;, &apos;responded&apos;);" target="_blank">responded</a> with:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Sorry @modernhiker I&#x2019;m an artist.&#x201D;</em></p><p>No, Ms. Nocket, you are not an artist, you are an idiot.</p><p>Ms. Nocket has been charged&#xA0;with seven counts of injury or depredation against government property in six national parks in Oregon, California, Utah and Colorado.&#xA0;She pleaded guilty to all seven counts.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-tPPHyxTjB0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
