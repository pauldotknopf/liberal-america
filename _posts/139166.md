<p>In 1999, Judge Victoria A. Roberts <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/us/law-requiring-drug-testing-of-welfare-parents-is-voided.html" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/us/law-requiring-drug-testing-of-welfare-parents-is-voided.html&apos;, &apos;ruled&apos;);">ruled</a> that a Michigan law requiring welfare recipients to take drug tests was unconstitutional. This was an important step in recognizing the unfairness of treating welfare recipients as potential drug users because of their economic circumstances.</p><p>Judge Roberts <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/citing-dangerous-precedent-federal-judge-blocks-mis-plan-drug-test-welfare-recipients" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.aclu.org/news/citing-dangerous-precedent-federal-judge-blocks-mis-plan-drug-test-welfare-recipients&apos;, &apos;said&apos;);">said</a>,</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#x201C;&#x2026;<em>Upholding this&#x2026;suspicionless drug testing would set a dangerous precedent&#x2026;drug testing under these circumstances must satisfy a special need, and that need must concern public safety</em>.&#x201D;</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.aclu.org/&apos;, &apos;ACLU&apos;);">ACLU</a>) Executive Director, Kary L.

While laws vary, federal, state, and private employers are allowed to subject their employees to drug testing. Jobs where drug testing is common include any job where people have access to heavy machinery, controlled substances, or weapons.</p><p>Some employers only make their employees submit to a drug test at the time of hire, or in the event of a workplace accident. Others submit their employees to drug tests at random intervals.</p><p>Advocates for testing welfare recipients claim that the state has a responsibility to ensure that tax dollars are not being used to fund illicit activities. They argue that a drug test can save the state a lot of money.</p><p>As of March 28, 2016, at least <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/drug-testing-and-public-assistance.aspx" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/drug-testing-and-public-assistance.aspx&apos;, &apos;17&apos;);">17</a> states either had programs in place to test recipients of government assistance for drugs, or they had proposals to put those programs in place.</p><p>The existing programs, however, produced little in the way of significant results.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/michigan-welfare-drug-testing-program" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/michigan-welfare-drug-testing-program&apos;, &apos;Michigan&apos;);">Michigan</a>, not a single one of the applicants for government assistance tested positive for drugs after appropriating $300,000 for the program.</p><p>In a <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/&apos;, &apos;Missouri&apos;);">Missouri</a>, a program that cost the state $1.35 million over the course of three years, only .001 percent of welfare recipients tested positive for drug use.</p><p><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/&apos;, &apos;Oklahoma&apos;);">Oklahoma</a>, spent $385, 872 in two years and had 297 positive drug test results.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/26/3624447/tanf-drug-testing-states/&apos;, &apos;Utah&apos;);">Utah</a>, 29 out of 9,552 applicants tested positive for drug use.

Where public policies are concerned, there should be no scapegoating. If The Top 1% Accountability Act is passed, perhaps the richest of Americans and the most needy Americans will be held to the same standards.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PLvhVPh5o98?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
