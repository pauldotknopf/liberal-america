<p>Appearing with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at a rally in Ohio today, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren wasted no time going after Donald Trump, telling the crowd gathered to hear Clinton that while Trump had called her &#x201C;Goofy Elizabeth Warren,&#x201D; she had a retort to his name-calling:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;You want to see goofy, look at him in that hat.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Yes, she does indeed have a point.</p><p>Warren also chided Trump for saying while in Scotland that he&#x2019;s a &#x201C;man of the people,&#x201D; remarking:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;When Donald Trump says &#x2018;great,&#x2019; I say, &#x2018;Great for who, exactly?&#x2019; For families that don&#x2019;t fly to Scotland to play golf?When he says &#x2018;Make America Great&#x2019; he means make it great for rich guys just like Donald Trump&#x2026;Watch out, because he will crush you into the dirt to get what he wants.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Senator Warren also had words of praise for Clinton, whom she may be running with on the Democratic ticket very soon. Warren said of Clinton:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;She knows you beat a bully not by tucking your tail and running, but by standing your ground and fighting back. She doesn&#x2019;t whine, she doesn&#x2019;t run to Twitter to call her opponents &#x2018;fat pigs&#x2019; or &#x2018;dummies.&#x2019; Hillary has brains, she has guts, she has a thick skin.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Even if Senator Warren doesn&#x2019;t wind up as the selection to be Clinton&#x2019;s running mate, you can bet she will be out on the campaign trail taking the fight to Donald Trump on a regular basis. He may insist on calling her &#x201C;Pocahontas,&#x201D; but she has more than a few derogatory names for him, too.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s Warren in Ohio this morning:</p>
