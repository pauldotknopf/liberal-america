<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Donald Trump, it has been said on more than one occasion, is a misogynist; a man who only sees women as sex objects and thinks they have no value other than what they can do for him.</p><p>Twenty-two years ago, <a href="http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/20/jane-doe-files-civil-rape-complaint-against-donald-trump-in-ny-court/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/20/jane-doe-files-civil-rape-complaint-against-donald-trump-in-ny-court/&apos;, &apos;according to a lawsuit&apos;);" target="_blank">according to a lawsuit</a> just filed against Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee attended a party held at the swanky Upper East Side apartment of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And at those parties, according to a plaintiff identified in court documents only as &#x201C;Jane Doe,&#x201D; Trump raped her. Her story is backed up by another woman, identified as &#x201C;Tiffany Doe,&#x201D; and here is <a href="http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/trump_rape_lawsuit.php" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/trump_rape_lawsuit.php&apos;, &apos;what they say&apos;);" target="_blank">what they say</a> happened in 1994:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;The lawsuit, which repeats some allegations made in a dismissed complaint filed in California in April, offers a graphic account of the young girl&#x2019;s alleged encounters with Trump, the worst of which is described as a &#x2018;savage sexual act.&#x2019; The lawsuit claims that during this instance, Trump tied her to the bed and struck her face with his hand, saying he could do what he wanted, despite her pleas for him to stop. The complaint alleges that Epstein also raped her.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The complaint was filed as a civil case in federal court against Trump, and it <a href="http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/trump_rape_lawsuit.php" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/trump_rape_lawsuit.php&apos;, &apos;also alleges&apos;);" target="_blank">also alleges</a> that both Trump and Epstein threatened to harm or kill the girl&#x2019;s family if she ever said anything about the sexual assaults:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Both defendants let plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This suit, which was filed in New York, is similar to one from April, in which a California woman&#xA0;identified as &#x201C;Katie Johnson&#x201D; alleged that Trump and Epstein had also raped her.&#xA0;That case was later dismissed due to the fact that Johnson didn&#x2019;t file the proper paperwork.</p><p>After the dismissal of the California case, Trump <a href="http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/20/jane-doe-files-civil-rape-complaint-against-donald-trump-in-ny-court/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/20/jane-doe-files-civil-rape-complaint-against-donald-trump-in-ny-court/&apos;, &apos;issued a statement&apos;);" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> saying:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;These allegations are not only false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.&#x201D;</em></p><p>When contacted for a comment on the New York suit, Trump&#x2019;s legal counsel <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/donald-trump-accused-of-raping-13-year-old-in-federal-lawsuit/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/donald-trump-accused-of-raping-13-year-old-in-federal-lawsuit/&apos;, &apos;said he&apos;);" target="_blank">said he</a> had not yet read the lawsuit.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Granted, this is nothing more than an allegation at this point, and it may never reach beyond this stage. For one thing &#x201C;Jane Doe&#x201D; must first get the five-year New York statute of limitations waived. But ask yourself this question: Do you doubt for a second that Donald Trump is capable of such behavior?</p><p><em>Featured Image Via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/8566717881" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/8566717881&apos;, &apos;Gage Skidmore for Flickr&apos;);" target="_blank">Gage Skidmore for Flickr</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&apos;, &apos;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic&apos;);" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic</a> License</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
