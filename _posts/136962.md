<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>I am a pastor. As a member of the clergy I have a calling to bring love and peace to every situation. My life is dedicated to bringing people to a place of community and shared holiness, in sacred communion with God, and in Christian fellowship with one another. My job is not to take sides, but to bring grace into the discussion. Wherever there is conflict, it is my job to create a space for calm understanding to enter. I&#x2019;m not always successful at this; there are times when my passion overtakes my mouth. But it is what I strive for.</p><p>Lately, I am afraid to speak where I feel called to speak, and say what I feel called to say. In our current political and social climate, attempting to show tolerance and love, speaking out against violence and hate, speaking against prejudice and injustice, are automatically interpreted to be political statements.</p><p>Maybe that&#x2019;s the discussion we should be having.</p><p>I just want to&#xA0;be able to stand with the oppressed and the marginalized, and preach the gospel of grace and love in which I believe, without being seen as a political revolutionary. Why does&#xA0;it require&#xA0;a political revolution to love your neighbor?</p><p>In this time of great sorrow, as we remember the friends and family of the lost souls in Orlando, may we also remember the value of the souls we live next to.&#xA0;Send your thoughts and prayers by showing unconditional compassion to someone you encounter today. The real revolution starts there.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A40&amp;version=MSG" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A40&amp;version=MSG&apos;, &apos;Matthew 25:37-40&apos;);" target="_blank">Matthew 25:37-40</a></em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>37-40 &#x201C;Then those &#x2018;sheep&#x2019; are going to say, &#x2018;Master, what are you talking about?
