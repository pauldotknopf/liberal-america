After the massacre at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/12/us/sandy-hook-timeline/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/12/us/sandy-hook-timeline/&apos;, &apos;Sandy Hook Elementary School&apos;);">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in 2014, the N.R.A. screamed that the Democrats were trying to &#x201C;<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/274461-norquist-accuses-obama-of-politicizing-sandy-hook-school-shooting" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/274461-norquist-accuses-obama-of-politicizing-sandy-hook-school-shooting&apos;, &apos;p0liticize&apos;);">p0liticize</a>&#x201D; the tragedy by bringing up the question of&#xA0;gun control. After the mass shooting at <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting&apos;, &apos;San Bernardino&apos;);">San Bernardino</a>, the N.R.A. called liberals &#x201C;<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/12/14/nra-uses-the-san-bernardino-mass-shooting-to-co/207475" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/12/14/nra-uses-the-san-bernardino-mass-shooting-to-co/207475&apos;, &apos;the Godless left&apos;);">the Godless left</a>&#x201D; because they wanted to do more than simply pray for safety.</p><p>So I suppose we shouldn&#x2019;t really be surprised when the same organization sinks to an unbelievable and disgusting new low. Somehow its still shocking to see just how hateful and vile these people truly are.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/qsZtEfUJM8" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://t.co/qsZtEfUJM8&apos;, &apos;pic.twitter.com/qsZtEfUJM8&apos;);">pic.twitter.com/qsZtEfUJM8</a></p>

The unusual action was&#xA0;taken by the Dems in an effort to force the House to act on a gun control bill.</p><p>To be clear, the Democrats were not trying to march in and take everyone&#x2019;s guns and ammo. They weren&#x2019;t demanding anything as outrageous as making sure that military weapons remain in the hands of the military. Nope. They were trying to force House Speaker Paul Ryan (R- Wi) to allow a roll call vote on a bill that would have prevented those on the terrorist watch from buying guns.</p><p>That&#x2019;s it. The bill would have simply stopped probable terrorists from buying weapons. Democrats wanted to openly and publicly discuss it and vote on it.</p><p>Speaker Ryan reacted exactly the way the gun lobby wanted him to react. He shut down the House, turned off the lights and cut the cameras. All the Republicans went home.</p><p>Democrats ignored him and stayed where they were. With cameras and mics turned off, many of them turned to social media to keep the public informed.</p><p>Cam Edwards, the N.R.A. radio host,&#xA0;looked at it differently. He was outraged that the Democrats broke the &#xA0;rules against running cameras when the House is not in session. This is what <a href="http://addictinginfo.org/2016/06/23/this-nra-radio-host-just-likened-dems-fighting-for-gun-safety-laws-to-criminals-and-terrorists-video/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://addictinginfo.org/2016/06/23/this-nra-radio-host-just-likened-dems-fighting-for-gun-safety-laws-to-criminals-and-terrorists-video/&apos;, &apos;he said&apos;);">he said</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;So in order to push legislation that the sponsors say would not have prevented the attacks in Orlando, Florida, they&#x2019;re also going to flout the House rules. Kind of like, you know, criminals and terrorists flout the rules that we have in place right now and will continue to do so?&#x201D;</span></em></p><p class="p1">Yup. Criminals and terrorists. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s what the N.R.A. wants to call the elected leaders who are trying to maybe make us all just a tiny bit safer. The people on the watch list who want to buy themselves a nice shiny AR-15?</p><p class="p1">The N.R.A. call them&#xA0;customers.</p><p class="p1">Watch below as the N.R.A. mouthpiece lectures us on &#x201C;civil rights.&#x201D;</p><p><!--Ads2--><br>
