<p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>A disgraced ex-cop, loser, and Donald Trump fanatic by the name of&#xA0;Jim Stachowiak is <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-loving-ex-cop-recruits-lone-wolf-patriots-to-open-fire-on-black-protesters-at-gop-convention/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-loving-ex-cop-recruits-lone-wolf-patriots-to-open-fire-on-black-protesters-at-gop-convention/&apos;, &apos;calling on&apos;);" target="_blank">calling on</a> &#x201C;lone wolf patriots&#x201D; to show up at the GOP convention in July, fully armed, so they can shoot at any black protesters who happen to show up.</p><p>Stachowiak <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abq7Pgp3K8" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abq7Pgp3K8&apos;, &apos;posted a video&apos;);" target="_blank">posted a video</a> to YouTube in which he declared:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;I am encouraging patriots and Trump supporters and those that support liberty and freedom to come lawfully armed with lethal and non-lethal weaponry.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Some <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-loving-ex-cop-recruits-lone-wolf-patriots-to-open-fire-on-black-protesters-at-gop-convention/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/trump-loving-ex-cop-recruits-lone-wolf-patriots-to-open-fire-on-black-protesters-at-gop-convention/&apos;, &apos;background&apos;);" target="_blank">background</a> on&#xA0;Jim Stachowiak is instructive to help one better understand just what an enormous heap of human excrement he truly is:</p><ul>
<li>He has been permanently banned from Facebook</li>
<li>He was charged with criminal defamation for identifying another person as a terrorist</li>
<li>He refers to the Black Lives Matter movement as, &#x201C;Black Lies Matter&#x201D;</li>
<li>He was fired from his job as a cop for official misconduct; a job he held for only three years</li>
</ul><p>Also in the YouTube video,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abq7Pgp3K8" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abq7Pgp3K8&apos;, &apos;Stachowiak says&apos;);" target="_blank">Stachowiak says</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;They (black protesters) have threatened to cause riots in Cleveland and nationwide.&#xA0;It is our sworn duty and obligation for all those like me and many of you who have taken the oath to defend this country against all enemies foreign and domestic.&#x201D;</em></p><p>And how does&#xA0;Stachowiak suggest his hired hit men do that? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abq7Pgp3K8" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abq7Pgp3K8&apos;, &apos;Like this&apos;);" target="_blank">Like this</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;We should answer the call with our Second Amendment. Yes, I&#x2019;m encouraging patriots to come prepared to defend this nation against a domestic terrorist organization supported by the terrorist in the White House, Obama.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Come prepared, because this may spark another revolution. It won&#x2019;t be decided if that spark turns into a bonfire by we who love liberty, for we will defend, not attack. We won&#x2019;t act, but we will react.&#x201D;</em></p><p>What I find most amazing about haters like this useless piece of garbage is that they decide to announce their plans on the internet, where everyone can see it. Which means the Cleveland Police Department, FBI, and Secret Service will be waiting for them when they arrive. We can only hope they provoke the cops and get arrested.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the video&#xA0;Stachowiak posted on YouTube:</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5abq7Pgp3K8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p><em>Featured Image Via YouTube Screengrab</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
