</div><p>Apparently Trump was displeased by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/13/donald-trump-suggests-president-obama-was-involved-with-orlando-shooting/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/13/donald-trump-suggests-president-obama-was-involved-with-orlando-shooting/&apos;, &apos;the Post\&apos;s article&apos;);">the Post&#x2019;s article</a> on his suggestions that President Obama was somehow complicit in Saturday night&#x2019;s bloodbath in Orlando. It was based on an interview on &#x201C;Fox &amp; Friends&#x201D; on Monday morning, in which he said this:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>&#x201C;Look, we&#x2019;re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he&#x2019;s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind &#x2014; you know, people can&#x2019;t believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can&#x2019;t even mention the words &#x2018;radical Islamic terrorism.&#x2019; There&#x2019;s something going on. It&#x2019;s inconceivable. There&#x2019;s something going on.&#x201D;</em></p><p>He went further in an interview on NBC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Today.&#x201D; Watch here.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oxf5n7NuIAc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p><p>When Savannah Guthrie asked Trump to clarify his remarks to the gang on the curvy couch, Trump replied that there are a lot of people who think Obama &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t want to get it&#x201D; and &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t want to know about it.&#x201D;</p><p>That led The Post to initially headline its piece as &#x201C;Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting.&#x201D; Shortly after the article went live, The Post&#xA0;toned the headline down&#x2013;without any prompting from the Donald&#x2013;to &#x201C;Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting.&#x201D; According to The Post, the new headline more accurately reflects what Trump said on Fox.&#xA0;That wasn&#x2019;t good enough for Trump, who declared that he &#x201C;no longer felt compelled to work with an organization that puts &#x2018;clicks&#x2019; above journalistic integrity.&#x201D;</p><p>The Post isn&#x2019;t taking this lying down. In a blistering response, executive editor Marty Baron rightly denounced this as an attack on the&#xA0;First Amendment.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donald Trump today revoked press credentials for <a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonpost" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://twitter.com/washingtonpost&apos;, &apos;@washingtonpost&apos;);">@washingtonpost</a>.
