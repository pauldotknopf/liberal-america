<p>A petition has begun circulating in Great Britain less than 24 hours after the Brexit vote <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/second-eu-referendum-petition_uk_576e3fcde4b0232d331dfcce" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/second-eu-referendum-petition_uk_576e3fcde4b0232d331dfcce&apos;, &apos;which would call for&apos;);" target="_blank">which would call for</a> a formal re-vote on the issue of the UK leaving the European Union. So far it has garnered over 1 million signatures. That is 10 times the number of signatures needed for it to be considered by the British parliament.</p><p>In a move that surprised most of the world, British voters <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/do-over-more-than-1-million-signatures-collected-in-uk-calling-for-a-re-vote-on-leaving-eu/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/do-over-more-than-1-million-signatures-collected-in-uk-calling-for-a-re-vote-on-leaving-eu/&apos;, &apos;approved leaving&apos;);" target="_blank">approved leaving</a> the European Union by a margin of 52 to 48 percent. Shortly after the results were announced, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, and he is expected to give up his post by no later than October.</p><p>Despite the vote, many <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/do-over-more-than-1-million-signatures-collected-in-uk-calling-for-a-re-vote-on-leaving-eu/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/do-over-more-than-1-million-signatures-collected-in-uk-calling-for-a-re-vote-on-leaving-eu/&apos;, &apos;experts are now saying&apos;);" target="_blank">experts are now saying</a> that formal withdrawal from the EU could take anywhere from 2 to 10 years.&#xA0;EU officials including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have called for Britain to begin negotiating its exit from the bloc immediately. But Cameron <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/second-eu-referendum-petition_uk_576e3fcde4b0232d331dfcce" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/second-eu-referendum-petition_uk_576e3fcde4b0232d331dfcce&apos;, &apos;indicated yesterday&apos;);" target="_blank">indicated yesterday</a> that he would not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. If he did, it would prompt the beginning of a two-year period of negotiations on Britain&#x2019;s exit.</p><p>Germany is currently at work <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/do-over-more-than-1-million-signatures-collected-in-uk-calling-for-a-re-vote-on-leaving-eu/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/do-over-more-than-1-million-signatures-collected-in-uk-calling-for-a-re-vote-on-leaving-eu/&apos;, &apos;on a plan&apos;);" target="_blank">on a plan</a> which would make the UK an associate member of the European Union.&#xA0;The document suggested by the German Finance Minister did not set out the precise conditions of such membership, but it did state that Britain would not be guaranteed access to the European single market, because such a concession might&#xA0;encourage other EU member states to consider holding referendums on their own membership.</p><p>The fact that a re-vote petition has over 1 million signatures in one day certainly indicates that many Brits are having buyer&#x2019;s remorse. One of the main promises of the &#x201C;leave&#x201D; campaign was that the millions of British pounds sent to the EU on an annual basis would be used to boost the National Health Service. But during an interview yesterday, one of the main supporters of Britain leaving the EU, Nigel Farage, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2016-06-24/brexit-leader-national-health-service-wont-reap-promised-millions" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2016-06-24/brexit-leader-national-health-service-wont-reap-promised-millions&apos;, &apos;admitted that&apos;);" target="_blank">admitted that</a> money would not be used to shore up the ailing NHS.</p>
