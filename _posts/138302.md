The President spoke at this year&#x2019;s summit at the Washington Hilton in Washington, DC.</p><p>Obama spoke to a group of young business people, reminding them that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/what-will-obama-do-after-presidency-224546" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/what-will-obama-do-after-presidency-224546&apos;, &apos;the U.S. is&apos;);">the U.S. is</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;an extraordinary place to do business.&#x201D;</em></p><p>As he spoke to the young business professionals in the room, the President talked about the fact that we&#xA0;should all think about what we would do if we had&#xA0;a chance to live at any time, in any place, to insure our own success. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/what-will-obama-do-after-presidency-224546" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/what-will-obama-do-after-presidency-224546&apos;, &apos;He said&apos;);">He said</a>:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has even been at any time in human history. Less violent. Less driven by division. You&#x2019;d choose today.&#x201D;</span></em></p><p class="p1">He went on to talk about our nation&#x2019;s steady private sector job growth, about rising high school graduation rates, and about the increasing number of Americans who now have health insurance under the <a href="http://www.affordable-health-insurance-plans.org/?as=44d44mgsdiyx1m03s5ots0pw&amp;kno=2&amp;wsc=51&amp;adv=1&amp;tk=Z29vZ2xlLGRvbWFpbnNfMSxIZWFsdGggLSBHb3YsYWZmb3JkYWJsZSBjYXJlIGFjdCxbYWZmb3JkYWJsZSBjYXJlIGFjdF0%3D&amp;kw=affordable%20care%20act&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=e&amp;cid=70635659405&amp;adposition=1t1&amp;heading=%C2%AE%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20Plans%20%28From%20%249%2F%20Week%29&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwqJ67BRCzzJ7Hy-LYlFYSJABwp9PG689hDf2pA2LG95beQ9RBW4QaupTx5bxUHeAu0PsFhxoCD_nw_wcB" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.affordable-health-insurance-plans.org/?as=44d44mgsdiyx1m03s5ots0pw&amp;kno=2&amp;wsc=51&amp;adv=1&amp;tk=Z29vZ2xlLGRvbWFpbnNfMSxIZWFsdGggLSBHb3YsYWZmb3JkYWJsZSBjYXJlIGFjdCxbYWZmb3JkYWJsZSBjYXJlIGFjdF0%3D&amp;kw=affordable%20care%20act&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=e&amp;cid=70635659405&amp;adposition=1t1&amp;heading=%C2%AE%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20Plans%20%28From%20%249%2F%20Week%29&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwqJ67BRCzzJ7Hy-LYlFYSJABwp9PG689hDf2pA2LG95beQ9RBW4QaupTx5bxUHeAu0PsFhxoCD_nw_wcB&apos;, &apos;Affordable Care Act&apos;);">Affordable Care Act</a>.</p><p class="p1">The President pointed out that this is a great time to be starting, or enhancing, a career in the United States. He said:</p><p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&#x201C;Our rule of law, our mature capital markets &#x2014; all of these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business.

I&#x2019;m gonna get on LinkedIn and, you know, see what comes up.&#x201D;</span></em></p><p><!--Ads2--></p><p>It&#x2019;s kind of funny to look back and see that in February, the President used LinkedIn to post about his very first job, scooping ice cream. He said that it wasn&#x2019;t really glamorous but that it taught him a lot about hard work.</p><p>Wouldn&#x2019;t it be completely hilarious to see Barack Obama out there on LinkedIn next December, advertising himself as a former ice cream scooper and Head of State?</p>
