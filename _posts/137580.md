The number of Republicans who favor more gun control&#xA0;fell from 55 percent in 2000 to 26 percent in 2015. That&#x2019;s nearly half of the formerly pro-gun control advocates changing their minds.</p><p>Among Democrats however, the support for gun control has been a stable 65 to 75 percent over that same period.<br>

What&#x2019;s worrisome for gun control advocates here is that both houses of Florida&#x2019;s legislature consist of Republican majorities.</p><p>Considering the statistics above, any changes in the aftermath of the Orlando massacre will likely move the state&#xA0;towards easier&#xA0;access to firearms.</p><p>Considering the <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/12/orlando-nightclub-massacre-just-one-1000-u-s-mass-shootings-since-sandy-hook/">rise</a> of mass shootings to almost one per day since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, and the vast increase of laws passed to loosen gun restrictions since 1989, the frightening conclusion is that new&#xA0;laws can&#x2019;t help prevent future massacres and current&#xA0;law makes it easier for mass shootings to happen.</p><p>For more information on the gun control debate, watch CBS&#x2019;s report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogyIyXKJ2W8" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogyIyXKJ2W8&apos;, &apos;here&apos;);">here</a>:</p><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ogyIyXKJ2W8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
