<p>To be a Black Republican has to be hard. It&#x2019;s probably even harder in a city like Atlanta. If you&#x2019;d like to make it even more difficult, become a <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/black-georgia-gop-official-booted-from-atlanta-trump-event-with-no-explanation/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/black-georgia-gop-official-booted-from-atlanta-trump-event-with-no-explanation/&apos;, &apos;Trump supporter&apos;);">Trump supporter</a> and see what happens.</p><p>Michael McNeely, an at-large delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention, is living that reality. McNeely is probably used to drawing a certain amount of attention&#x2013;he used to lead the Georgia Black Republican Council. But it seems he got more than he bargained for at a Trump rally in Atlanta.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/darrensands/georgia-gop-official-removed-from-atlanta-trump-event?utm_term=.ujwWZM37l#.iyWOL0Ez4" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;https://www.buzzfeed.com/darrensands/georgia-gop-official-removed-from-atlanta-trump-event?utm_term=.ujwWZM37l#.iyWOL0Ez4&apos;, &apos;BuzzFeed&apos;);">BuzzFeed</a>,when McNeely headed backstage with other GOP leaders, he was stopped at the door and turned away by a Trump campaign staffer who told him&#xA0;there was &#x201C;no more room for you.&#x201D;</p><p>There was no official explanation for why there was room for everyone else, and so far, no official reason for the ouster has been given. McNeely has declined to comment.</p><p>Bruce LeVell of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump did offer one observation.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Anyone that goes to a Trump rally, I don&#x2019;t give a damn who you are, if anyone even if looks at you and [the campaign] points their finger, you&#x2019;re out of there,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re real strict about [acting] if something doesn&#x2019;t look right. They just make a judgment call.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Hmmmmm&#x2026;what could look wrong or out of place for a Republican National Convention delegate at the presumptive nominee&#x2019;s campaign event?</p><p>Trump rallies have gained quite a reputation for being inhospitable to people who look like McNeely. A Liberal America reporter <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/03/04/the-truth-i-survived-a-trump-rally-and-this-was-what-i-saw-video/">shared</a> what she saw at a Kentucky rally, and a gentleman in Dayton, Ohio chronicled his unpleasant&#xA0;<a href="http://fusion.net/story/280795/donald-trump-dayton-rally/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://fusion.net/story/280795/donald-trump-dayton-rally/&apos;, &apos;experience&apos;);">experience</a>&#xA0;for Fusion.net. A&#xA0;few months before McNeely&#x2019;s ouster, at another rally, Georgia students (who happen to look like McNeely as well) were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/29/donald-trump-georgia-rally-valdosta/81129964/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/29/donald-trump-georgia-rally-valdosta/81129964/&apos;, &apos;kicked out&apos;);">kicked out</a>.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Donald Trump has not made inroads to &#x201C;the Blacks&#x201D; despite his claims of adoration by and for them. If the small number of blacks willing to publicly support him are treated this way, his future prospects don&#x2019;t seem promising.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5nXwR_27DM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p><em>Featured image, &#xA0;YouTube screengrab</em></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
