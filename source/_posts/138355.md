He is okay with Trump&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/08/lyin-ryan-lets-unite-behind-trump-despite-racist-comment/" target="_blank">racism</a> because he has &#x201C;more common ground&#x201D; with Trump than with Clinton. He admitted that Trump&#x2019;s comments about&#xA0;the Trump University judge are the definition of racist, but he is still voting for Trump.</p><div id="attachment_138373" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-138373 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/paul_ryan-e1466528536806.png?resize=640%2C358" alt="Paul Ryan" data-recalc-dims="1">

</div><p>Chuck Todd was interviewing Paul Ryan and Todd confronted Ryan about Trump&#x2019;s racism.

You thought he made a racist statement. How are you comfortable still supporting him?&#x201D;</em></p><p>Ryan danced around an answer by <a href="http://www.aol.com/article/2016/06/19/chuck-todd-confronts-paul-ryan-over-donald-trump-how-are-you-c/21398093/" onclick="__gaTracker(&apos;send&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;outbound-article&apos;, &apos;http://www.aol.com/article/2016/06/19/chuck-todd-confronts-paul-ryan-over-donald-trump-how-are-you-c/21398093/&apos;, &apos;saying&apos;);" target="_blank">saying</a>:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#x201C;Imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress.&#x201D;</em></p><p>This is the same man who wants to bring back the pre-existing <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/04/28/paul-ryan-doesnt-care-about-human-life/" target="_blank">restrictions</a> on health insurance. He is okay with racism, but he wants people to go bankrupt from their health bills.</p><p><!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quicksense.net/ --></p><p>Ryan wants party unity. He <a href="http://www.liberalamerica.org/2016/06/02/breaking-paul-ryan-will-vote-for-donald-trump-video/" target="_blank">thinks</a> that he can help heal the damage that Trump has caused to the Republican Party.

I don&#x2019;t want see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a dis-unified party.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Todd accused Ryan of choosing &#x201C;party over country.&#x201D; Ryan, of course, denied it by saying that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to agree with Clinton.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVEiq7Oe0Lo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div style="font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both"></div>
